Its 1951 second edition (fifth\\r\\nimpression) contains a significantly revised portion of Chapter V, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRiddles in the\\r\\nDark,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which brings the story of The Hobbit more in line with its sequel, The\\r\\nLord of the Rings, then in progress. Tolkien made some further revisions to the\\r\\nAmerican edition published by Ballantine Books in February 1966, and to the\\r\\nBritish third edition (sixteenth impression) published by George Allen & Unwin\\r\\nlater that same year.\\r\\n    For the 1995 British hardcover edition, published by HarperCollins, the text\\r\\nof The Hobbit was entered into word-processing files, and a number of further\\r\\ncorrections of misprints and errors were made. Since then, various editions of\\r\\nThe Hobbit have been generated from that computerized text file. For the present\\r\\ntext, that file has been compared again, line by line, with the earlier editions, and\\r\\na number of further corrections have been made to present a text that, as closely\\r\\nas possible, represents Tolkien\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final intended form.\\r\\n    Readers interested in details of the changes made at various times to the text\\r\\nof The Hobbit are referred to Appendix A, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTextual and Revisional Notes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\r\\nThe Annotated Hobbit (1988), and J. R. R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography\\r\\nby Wayne G. Hammond, with the assistance of Douglas A. Anderson (1993).\\r\\n\\r\\n                                                              Douglas A. Anderson\\r\\n                                                                        May 2001\\r\\n\\x0c\\x0cAuthor's Note\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a story of long ago. At that time the languages and letters were quite\\r\\ndifferent from ours of today. English is used to represent the languages. But two\\r\\npoints may be noted. (1) In English the only correct plural of dwarf is dwarfs,\\r\\nand the adjective is dwarfish. In this story dwarves and dwarvish are used*, but\\r\\nonly when speaking of the ancient people to whom Thorin Oakenshield and his\\r\\ncompanions belonged. (2) Orc is not an English word. It occurs in one or two\\r\\nplaces but is usually translated goblin (or hobgoblin for the larger kinds). Orc is\\r\\nthe hobbits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 form of the name given at that time to these creatures, and it is not\\r\\nconnected at all with our orc, ork, applied to sea-animals of dolphin-kind.\\r\\n    Runes were old letters originally used for cutting or scratching on wood,\\r\\nstone, or metal, and so were thin and angular. At the time of this tale only the\\r\\nDwarves made regular use of them, especially for private or secret records. Their\\r\\nrunes are in this book represented by English runes, which are known now to\\r\\nfew people. If the runes on Thror\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Map are compared with the transcriptions\\r\\ninto modern letters\\xe2\\x80\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\xa0, the alphabet, adapted to modern English, can be\\r\\ndiscovered and the above runic title also read. On the Map all the normal runes\\r\\nare found, except for X. I and U are used for J and V. There was no rune for Q\\r\\n(use CW); nor for Z (the dwarf-rune may be used if required). It will be found,\\r\\nhowever, that some single runes stand for two modern letters: th, ng, ee; other\\r\\nrunes of the same kind ( ea and st) were also sometimes used. The secret\\r\\ndoor was marked D . From the side a hand pointed to this, and under it was\\r\\nwritten:                                                                The last\\r\\ntwo runes are the initials of Thror and Thrain. The moon-runes read by Elrond\\r\\n\\r\\nwere:\\r\\n\\x0c   On the Map the compass points are marked in runes, with East at the top, as\\r\\nusual in dwarf-maps, and so read clockwise: E(ast), S(outh), W(est), N(orth).\\r\\n\\x0cChapter I\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAN UNEXPECTED PARTY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled\\r\\nwith the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with\\r\\nnothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means\\r\\ncomfort.\\r\\n    It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny\\r\\nyellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall\\r\\nlike a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and\\r\\nfloors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs\\r\\nfor hats and coats\\xe2\\x80\\x94the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on,\\r\\ngoing fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill\\xe2\\x80\\x94The Hill, as all the\\r\\npeople for many miles round called it\\xe2\\x80\\x94and many little round doors opened out\\r\\nof it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit:\\r\\nbedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole\\r\\nrooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor,\\r\\nand indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side\\r\\n(going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round\\r\\nwindows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the\\r\\nriver.\\r\\n    This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The\\r\\nBagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and\\r\\npeople considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were\\r\\nrich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected:\\r\\nyou could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of\\r\\nasking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found\\r\\nhimself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the\\r\\n\\x0cneighbours\\xe2\\x80\\x99 respect, but he gained\\xe2\\x80\\x94well, you will see whether he gained\\r\\nanything in the end.\\r\\n     The mother of our particular hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x94what is a hobbit? I suppose hobbits\\r\\nneed some description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the\\r\\nBig People, as they call us. They are (or were) a little people, about half our\\r\\nheight, and smaller than the bearded Dwarves. Hobbits have no beards. There is\\r\\nlittle or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps\\r\\nthem to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me\\r\\ncome blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a\\r\\nmile off. They are inclined to be fat in the stomach; they dress in bright colours\\r\\n(chiefly green and yellow); wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural\\r\\nleathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is\\r\\ncurly); have long clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep\\r\\nfruity laughs (especially after dinner, which they have twice a day when they can\\r\\nget it). Now you know enough to go on with. As I was saying, the mother of this\\r\\nhobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x94of Bilbo Baggins, that is\\xe2\\x80\\x94was the famous Belladonna Took, one of the\\r\\nthree remarkable daughters of the Old Took, head of the hobbits who lived\\r\\nacross The Water, the small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said\\r\\n(in other families) that long ago one of the Took ancestors must have taken a\\r\\nfairy wife. That was, of course, absurd, but certainly there was still something\\r\\nnot entirely hobbitlike about them, and once in a while members of the Took-\\r\\nclan would go and have adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and the family\\r\\nhushed it up; but the fact remained that the Tooks were not as respectable as the\\r\\nBagginses, though they were undoubtedly richer.\\r\\n     Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after she became Mrs.\\r\\nBungo Baggins. Bungo, that was Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, built the most luxurious hobbit-\\r\\nhole for her (and partly with her money) that was to be found either under The\\r\\nHill or over The Hill or across The Water, and there they remained to the end of\\r\\ntheir days. Still it is probable that Bilbo, her only son, although he looked and\\r\\nbehaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father, got\\r\\nsomething a bit queer in his make-up from the Took side, something that only\\r\\nwaited for a chance to come out. The chance never arrived, until Bilbo Baggins\\r\\nwas grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in the beautiful\\r\\nhobbit-hole built by his father, which I have just described for you, until he had\\r\\nin fact apparently settled down immovably.\\r\\n     By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world,\\r\\nwhen there was less noise and more green, and the hobbits were still numerous\\r\\n\\x0cand prosperous, and Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast\\r\\nsmoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly\\r\\ntoes (neatly brushed)\\xe2\\x80\\x94Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a\\r\\nquarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all\\r\\nthere is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and\\r\\nadventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most\\r\\nextraordinary fashion. He had not been down that way under The Hill for ages\\r\\nand ages, not since his friend the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had\\r\\nalmost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and\\r\\nacross The Water on businesses of his own since they were all small hobbit-boys\\r\\nand hobbit-girls.\\r\\n    All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff.\\r\\nHe had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which his\\r\\nlong white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Morning!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, and he meant it. The sun was shining, and the\\r\\ngrass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy\\r\\neyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you wish me a good morning, or mean\\r\\nthat it is a good morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel good this\\r\\nmorning; or that it is a morning to be good on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll of them at once,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd a very fine morning for a pipe of\\r\\ntobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down and\\r\\nhave a fill of mine! There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no hurry, we have all the day before us!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then Bilbo\\r\\nsat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey\\r\\nring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over\\r\\nThe Hill.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery pretty!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I have no time to blow smoke-rings this\\r\\nmorning. I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging,\\r\\nand it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very difficult to find anyone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should think so\\xe2\\x80\\x94in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use\\r\\nfor adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for\\r\\ndinner! I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think what anybody sees in them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said our Mr. Baggins, and\\r\\nstuck one thumb behind his braces, and blew out another even bigger smoke-\\r\\nring. Then he took out his morning letters, and began to read, pretending to take\\r\\nno more notice of the old man. He had decided that he was not quite his sort, and\\r\\nwanted him to go away. But the old man did not move. He stood leaning on his\\r\\nstick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite\\r\\n\\x0cuncomfortable and even a little cross.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood morning!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any adventures here, thank\\r\\nyou! You might try over The Hill or across The Water.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d By this he meant that the\\r\\nconversation was at an end.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a lot of things you do use Good morning for!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow\\r\\nyou mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be good till I move\\r\\noff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me see, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I know your\\r\\nname?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, my dear sir\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I do know your name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And\\r\\nyou do know my name, though you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember that I belong to it. I am\\r\\nGandalf, and Gandalf means me! To think that I should have lived to be good-\\r\\nmorninged by Belladonna Took\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not the wandering wizard that gave\\r\\nOld Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never\\r\\ncame undone till ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales\\r\\nat parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and\\r\\nthe unexpected luck of widows\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sons? Not the man that used to make such\\r\\nparticularly excellent fireworks! I remember those! Old Took used to have them\\r\\non Midsummer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eve. Splendid! They used to go up like great lilies and\\r\\nsnapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d You\\r\\nwill notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to\\r\\nbelieve, also that he was very fond of flowers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot the\\r\\nGandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the\\r\\nBlue for mad adventures? Anything from climbing trees to visiting elves\\xe2\\x80\\x94or\\r\\nsailing in ships, sailing to other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite inter\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nmean, you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your\\r\\npardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere else should I be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll the same I am pleased to find\\r\\nyou remember something about me. You seem to remember my fireworks\\r\\nkindly, at any rate, and that is not without hope. Indeed for your old grandfather\\r\\nTook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked\\r\\nfor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg your pardon, I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t asked for anything!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far\\r\\nas to send you on this adventure. Very amusing for me, very good for you\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nprofitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSorry! I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any adventures, thank you. Not today. Good morning!\\r\\nBut please come to tea\\xe2\\x80\\x94any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come\\r\\ntomorrow! Good bye!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d With that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round\\r\\ngreen door, and shut it as quickly as he dared, not to seem rude. Wizards after all\\r\\nare wizards.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat on earth did I ask him to tea for!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, as he went to the\\r\\npantry. He had only just had breakfast, but he thought a cake or two and a drink\\r\\nof something would do him good after his fright.\\r\\n    Gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door, and laughing\\r\\nlong but quietly. After a while he stepped up, and with the spike on his staff\\r\\nscratched a queer sign on the hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beautiful green front-door. Then he strode\\r\\naway, just about the time when Bilbo was finishing his second cake and\\r\\nbeginning to think that he had escaped adventures very well.\\r\\n    The next day he had almost forgotten about Gandalf. He did not remember\\r\\nthings very well, unless he put them down on his Engagement Tablet: like this:\\r\\nGandalf Tea Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of\\r\\nthe kind.\\r\\n    Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and\\r\\nthen he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup\\r\\nand saucer, and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am so sorry to keep you waiting!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he was going to say, when he saw that it\\r\\nwas not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden\\r\\nbelt, and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon as the door was\\r\\nopened, he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected.\\r\\n    He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDwalin at your service!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe said with a low bow.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBilbo Baggins at yours!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions\\r\\nfor the moment. When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he\\r\\nadded: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A little\\r\\nstiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited\\r\\ndwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?\\r\\n    They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third\\r\\ncake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcuse me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the hobbit, and off he went to the door.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you have got here at last!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That was what he was going to say to Gandalf\\r\\nthis time. But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on\\r\\nthe step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon\\r\\n\\x0cas the door was open, just as if he had been invited.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see they have begun to arrive already,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said when he caught sight of\\r\\nDwalin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBalin at\\r\\nyour service!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with his hand on his breast.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but\\r\\nthey have begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He liked visitors, but he liked\\r\\nto know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask them himself. He had\\r\\na horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then he\\xe2\\x80\\x94as the host: he\\r\\nknew his duty and stuck to it however painful\\xe2\\x80\\x94he might have to go without.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome along in, and have some tea!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he managed to say after taking a deep\\r\\nbreath.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Balin with the white beard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind some cake\\xe2\\x80\\x94seed-cake, if you\\r\\nhave any.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLots!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found\\r\\nhimself scuttling off, too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and then to a\\r\\npantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-cakes which he had baked that\\r\\nafternoon for his after-supper morsel.\\r\\n    When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends\\r\\n(as a matter of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the\\r\\ncake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another\\r\\nring.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGandalf for certain this time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought as he puffed along the passage.\\r\\nBut it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and\\r\\nyellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they\\r\\nhopped, as soon as the door began to open\\xe2\\x80\\x94Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat can I do for you, my dwarves?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKili at your service!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the one. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd Fili!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d added the other; and they\\r\\nboth swept off their blue hoods and bowed.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt yours and your family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Bilbo, remembering his manners this\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDwalin and Balin here already, I see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Kili. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us join the throng!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThrong!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Mr. Baggins. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the sound of that. I really must\\r\\nsit down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He had only just\\r\\nhad a sip\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the corner, while the four dwarves sat round the table, and talked\\r\\nabout mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and the depredations of\\r\\ndragons, and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want\\r\\n\\x0cto, for they sounded much too adventurous\\xe2\\x80\\x94when, ding-dong-a-ling-dang, his\\r\\nbell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle\\r\\noff.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomeone at the door!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, blinking.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome four, I should say by the sound,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fili. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides, we saw them\\r\\ncoming along behind us in the distance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and\\r\\nwondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they\\r\\nwould all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to\\r\\nrun to the door. It was not four after all, it was five. Another dwarf had come\\r\\nalong while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, before\\r\\nthey were all inside, bowing and saying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat your service\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one after another. Dori,\\r\\nNori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a\\r\\ngrey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off\\r\\nthey marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join\\r\\nthe others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and\\r\\nsome for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was\\r\\nkept very busy for a while.\\r\\n    A big jug of coffee had just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone,\\r\\nand the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\na loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beautiful green door.\\r\\nSomebody was banging with a stick!\\r\\n    Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and\\r\\nbewuthered\\xe2\\x80\\x94this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He\\r\\npulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other.\\r\\nMore dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff\\r\\nand laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the\\r\\nway, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCarefully! Carefully!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends\\r\\nwaiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce\\r\\nBifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt your service!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then\\r\\nthey hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one\\r\\nwith a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important\\r\\ndwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not\\r\\nat all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top\\r\\nof him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was\\r\\n\\x0cvery haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was\\r\\nsorry so many times, that at last he grunted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpray don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and stopped\\r\\nfrowning.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we are all here!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nthe best detachable party hoods\\xe2\\x80\\x94and his own hat hanging on the pegs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite a\\r\\nmerry gathering! I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and\\r\\ndrink! What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd for me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd raspberry jam and apple-tart,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bifur.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd mince-pies and cheese,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bofur.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd pork-pie and salad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bombur.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd more cakes\\xe2\\x80\\x94and ale\\xe2\\x80\\x94and coffee, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d called the other\\r\\ndwarves through the door.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPut on a few eggs, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good fellow!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gandalf called after him, as the\\r\\nhobbit stumped off to the pantries. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd just bring out the cold chicken and\\r\\npickles!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nthought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning\\r\\nto wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house.\\r\\nBy the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses\\r\\nand plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot,\\r\\nand red in the face, and annoyed.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConfusticate and bebother these dwarves!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said aloud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they\\r\\ncome and lend a hand?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door\\r\\nof the kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could say knife they\\r\\nhad whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out\\r\\neverything afresh.\\r\\n    Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round: and\\r\\nBilbo sat on a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite\\r\\ntaken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the\\r\\nleast an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got\\r\\non. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the\\r\\nplates and glasses.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you will all stay to supper?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in his politest unpressing\\r\\ntones.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd after. We shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get through the business till\\r\\nlate, and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    Thereupon the twelve dwarves\\xe2\\x80\\x94not Thorin, he was too important, and\\r\\nstayed talking to Gandalf\\xe2\\x80\\x94jumped to their feet, and made tall piles of all the\\r\\nthings. Off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each\\r\\nwith a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost\\r\\nsqueaking with fright: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplease be careful!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplease, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t trouble! I can\\r\\nmanage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But the dwarves only started to sing:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Chip the glasses and crack the plates!\\r\\n         Blunt the knives and bend the forks!\\r\\n       That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what Bilbo Baggins hates\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\r\\n         Smash the bottles and burn the corks!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!\\r\\n         Pour the milk on the pantry floor!\\r\\n       Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!\\r\\n         Splash the wine on every door!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl;\\r\\n         Pound them up with a thumping pole;\\r\\n       And when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve finished, if any are whole,\\r\\n         Send them down the hall to roll!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what Bilbo Baggins hates!\\r\\n       So, carefully! carefully with the plates!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    And of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was\\r\\ncleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning\\r\\nround and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing.\\r\\nThen they went back, and found Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a\\r\\npipe. He was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one\\r\\nto go, it went\\xe2\\x80\\x94up the chimney, or behind the clock on the mantelpiece, or under\\r\\nthe table, or round and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick\\r\\nenough to escape Gandalf. Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short\\r\\nclay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Then Gandalf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smoke-ring\\r\\n\\x0cwould go green and come back to hover over the wizard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head. He had a cloud\\r\\nof them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and\\r\\nsorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched\\xe2\\x80\\x94he loved smoke-rings\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then he\\r\\nblushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings\\r\\nhe had sent up the wind over The Hill.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow for some music!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBring out the instruments!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles; Dori, Nori,\\r\\nand Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced\\r\\na drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too, and came back with clarinets\\r\\nthat they had left among the walking-sticks. Dwalin and Balin said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcuse me,\\r\\nI left mine in the porch!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust bring mine in with you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. They came\\r\\nback with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s harp wrapped in a green\\r\\ncloth. It was a beautiful golden harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began\\r\\nall at once, so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept\\r\\naway into dark lands under strange moons, far over The Water and very far from\\r\\nhis hobbit-hole under The Hill.\\r\\n    The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of\\r\\nThe Hill; the firelight flickered\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was April\\xe2\\x80\\x94and still they played on, while\\r\\nthe shadow of Gandalf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beard wagged against the wall.\\r\\n    The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were\\r\\nlost, and still they played on. And suddenly first one and then another began to\\r\\nsing as they played, deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of\\r\\ntheir ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like\\r\\ntheir song without their music.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Far over the misty mountains cold\\r\\n       To dungeons deep and caverns old\\r\\n       We must away ere break of day\\r\\n       To seek the pale enchanted gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,\\r\\n       While hammers fell like ringing bells\\r\\n       In places deep, where dark things sleep,\\r\\n       In hollow halls beneath the fells.\\r\\n\\x0cFor ancient king and elvish lord\\r\\nThere many a gleaming golden hoard\\r\\nThey shaped and wrought, and light they caught\\r\\nTo hide in gems on hilt of sword.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn silver necklaces they strung\\r\\nThe flowering stars, on crowns they hung\\r\\nThe dragon-fire, in twisted wire\\r\\nThey meshed the light of moon and sun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFar over the misty mountains cold\\r\\nTo dungeons deep and caverns old\\r\\nWe must away, ere break of day,\\r\\nTo claim our long-forgotten gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGoblets they carved there for themselves\\r\\nAnd harps of gold; where no man delves\\r\\nThere lay they long, and many a song\\r\\nWas sung unheard by men or elves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pines were roaring on the height,\\r\\nThe winds were moaning in the night.\\r\\nThe fire was red, it flaming spread;\\r\\nThe trees like torches blazed with light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bells were ringing in the dale\\r\\nAnd men looked up with faces pale;\\r\\nThe dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ire more fierce than fire\\r\\nLaid low their towers and houses frail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mountain smoked beneath the moon;\\r\\nThe dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.\\r\\nThey fled their hall to dying fall\\r\\n\\x0c       Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Far over the misty mountains grim\\r\\n       To dungeons deep and caverns dim\\r\\n       We must away, ere break of day,\\r\\n       To win our harps and gold from him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and\\r\\nby cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and a jealous love, the\\r\\ndesire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him,\\r\\nand he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the\\r\\nwaterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick.\\r\\nHe looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees.\\r\\nHe thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the\\r\\nwood beyond The Water a flame leapt up\\xe2\\x80\\x94probably somebody lighting a wood-\\r\\nfire\\xe2\\x80\\x94and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and\\r\\nkindling it all to flames. He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr.\\r\\nBaggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again.\\r\\n    He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and\\r\\nmore than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer-barrels in\\r\\nthe cellar, and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away. Suddenly\\r\\nhe found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at\\r\\nhim with eyes shining in the dark.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere are you going?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he\\r\\nguessed both halves of the hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about a little light?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo apologetically.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe like the dark,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said all the dwarves. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDark for dark business! There are\\r\\nmany hours before dawn.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat\\r\\nin the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHush!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet Thorin speak!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And this is how Thorin began.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are met together in the house of our\\r\\nfriend and fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x94may\\r\\nthe hair on his toes never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale!\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He paused\\r\\nfor breath and for a polite remark from the hobbit, but the compliments were\\r\\nquite lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being\\r\\n\\x0ccalled audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out,\\r\\nhe was so flummoxed. So Thorin went on:\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. We\\r\\nshall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from\\r\\nwhich some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the\\r\\ningenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object\\r\\nis, I take it, well known to us all. To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to\\r\\none or two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and\\r\\nFili, for instance), the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief\\r\\nexplanation\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     This was Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed,\\r\\nhe would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without\\r\\ntelling any one there anything that was not known already. But he was rudely\\r\\ninterrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bear it any longer. At may never return he began\\r\\nto feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an\\r\\nengine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang up, knocking over the\\r\\ntable. Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff, and in its\\r\\nfirework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug,\\r\\nshaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on\\r\\ncalling out \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstruck by lightning, struck by lightning!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d over and over again; and\\r\\nthat was all they could get out of him for a long time. So they took him and laid\\r\\nhim out of the way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they\\r\\nwent back to their dark business.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcitable little fellow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, as they sat down again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGets funny\\r\\nqueer fits, but he is one of the best, one of the best\\xe2\\x80\\x94as fierce as a dragon in a\\r\\npinch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realize that this was only\\r\\npoetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great-grand-\\r\\nuncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a horse. He\\r\\ncharged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green\\r\\nFields, and knocked their king Golfimbul\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head clean off with a wooden club. It\\r\\nsailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit-hole, and in this\\r\\nway the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.\\r\\n     In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentler descendant was reviving in\\r\\nthe drawing-room. After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the\\r\\nparlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHumph!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (or some snort more\\r\\nor less like that). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWill he do, do you think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk\\r\\n\\x0cabout this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement\\r\\nwould be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I\\r\\nthink it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for\\r\\nthe sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house.\\r\\nAs soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat, I\\r\\nhad my doubts. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He\\r\\nsuddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for\\r\\nlittle fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a time\\r\\nafterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now, and he said to himself:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPardon me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif I have overheard words that you were saying. I\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pretend to understand what you are talking about, or your reference to\\r\\nburglars, but I think I am right in believing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (this is what he called being on his\\r\\ndignity) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you think I am no good. I will show you. I have no signs on my\\r\\ndoor\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was painted a week ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94, and I am quite sure you have come to the\\r\\nwrong house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the door-step, I had my\\r\\ndoubts. But treat it as the right one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try it,\\r\\nif I have to walk from here to the East of East and fight the wild Were-worms in\\r\\nthe Last Desert. I had a great-great-great-grand-uncle once, Bullroarer Took, and\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes, but that was long ago,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gloin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was talking about you. And I\\r\\nassure you there is a mark on this door\\xe2\\x80\\x94the usual one in the trade, or used to be.\\r\\nBurglar wants a good job, plenty of Excitement and reasonable Reward, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhow it is usually read. You can say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar if\\r\\nyou like. Some of them do. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was\\r\\na man of the sort in these parts looking for a Job at once, and that he had\\r\\narranged for a meeting here this Wednesday tea-time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course there is a mark,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI put it there myself. For very\\r\\ngood reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and\\r\\nI chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong\\r\\nhouse, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back\\r\\nto digging coal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and\\r\\nwhen Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at\\r\\nhim and stuck out his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a\\r\\nsnap. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have no more argument. I have chosen\\r\\n\\x0cMr. Baggins and that ought to be enough for all of you. If I say he is a Burglar, a\\r\\nBurglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than\\r\\nyou guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. You may (possibly)\\r\\nall live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have a\\r\\nlittle light on this!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shade he spread a piece of\\r\\nparchment rather like a map.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in answer to the\\r\\ndwarves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 excited questions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a plan of the Mountain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that this will help us much,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin disappointedly after a\\r\\nglance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I\\r\\nknow where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons\\r\\nbred.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it will be\\r\\neasy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is one point that you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t noticed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand that is the\\r\\nsecret entrance. You see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it\\r\\nfrom the other runes? That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Look at\\r\\nthe map at the beginning of this book, and you will see there the runes.)\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may have been secret once,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut how do we know that it is\\r\\nsecret any longer? Old Smaug has lived there long enough now to find out\\r\\nanything there is to know about those caves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe may\\xe2\\x80\\x94but he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have used it for years and years.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause it is too small. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsay the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he\\r\\nwas a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and\\r\\nmen of Dale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems a great big hole to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of\\r\\ndragons and only of hobbit-holes). He was getting excited and interested again,\\r\\nso that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there\\r\\nhung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite walks marked on it\\r\\nin red ink. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside,\\r\\napart from the dragon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must\\r\\nremember.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn lots of ways,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut in what way this one has been hidden\\r\\nwe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know without going to see. From what it says on the map I should\\r\\n\\x0cguess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the side of\\r\\nthe Mountain. That is the usual dwarves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 method\\xe2\\x80\\x94I think that is right, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlso,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d went on Gandalf, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a\\r\\nsmall and curious key. Here it is!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a\\r\\nlong barrel and intricate wards, made of silver. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeep it safe!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I will,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung\\r\\nabout his neck and under his jacket. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow things begin to look more hopeful.\\r\\nThis news alters them much for the better. So far we have had no clear idea what\\r\\nto do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the\\r\\nLong Lake. After that the trouble would begin\\xe2\\x80\\x94.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA long time before that, if I know anything about the roads East,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ninterrupted Gandalf.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe might go from there up along the River Running,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d went on Thorin\\r\\ntaking no notice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand so to the ruins of Dale\\xe2\\x80\\x94the old town in the valley there,\\r\\nunder the shadow of the Mountain. But we none of us liked the idea of the Front\\r\\nGate. The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the South of the\\r\\nMountain, and out of it comes the dragon too\\xe2\\x80\\x94far too often, unless he has\\r\\nchanged his habits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat would be no good,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot without a mighty Warrior,\\r\\neven a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in\\r\\ndistant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply not to be\\r\\nfound. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and\\r\\nshields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are comfortably far-off (and\\r\\ntherefore legendary). That is why I settled on burglary\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially when I\\r\\nremembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins,\\r\\nthe burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get on and make some\\r\\nplans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupposing the burglar-expert gives us some\\r\\nideas or suggestions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFirst I should like to know a bit more about things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, feeling all\\r\\nconfused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still Tookishly determined to go on\\r\\nwith things. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean about the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it got\\r\\nthere, and who it belongs to, and so on and further.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBless me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you got a map? and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you hear our\\r\\nsong? and haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we been talking about all this for hours?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll the same, I should like it all plain and clear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he obstinately, putting\\r\\n\\x0con his business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money\\r\\noff him), and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live\\r\\nup to Gandalf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recommendation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlso I should like to know about risks, out-\\r\\nof-pocket expenses, time required and remuneration, and so forth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94by which he\\r\\nmeant: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLong ago in my grandfather Thror\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time our\\r\\nfamily was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and\\r\\ntheir tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered by my far\\r\\nancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made\\r\\nhuger halls and greater workshops\\xe2\\x80\\x94and in addition I believe they found a good\\r\\ndeal of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and\\r\\nfamous, and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again, and treated\\r\\nwith great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, and were\\r\\ngradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by\\r\\nthe Mountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used\\r\\nto send for our smiths, and reward even the least skillful most richly. Fathers\\r\\nwould beg us to take their sons as apprentices, and pay us handsomely,\\r\\nespecially in food-supplies, which we never bothered to grow or find for\\r\\nourselves. Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had\\r\\nmoney to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun\\r\\nof it, not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is\\r\\nnot to be found in the world now-a-days. So my grandfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s halls became full\\r\\nof armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy market of Dale was the\\r\\nwonder of the North.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUndoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. Dragons steal gold and\\r\\njewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find\\r\\nthem; and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically for\\r\\never, unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they\\r\\nhardly know a good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good\\r\\nnotion of the current market value; and they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a thing for themselves,\\r\\nnot even mend a little loose scale of their armour. There were lots of dragons in\\r\\nthe North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the\\r\\ndwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction\\r\\nthat dragons make going from bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy,\\r\\nstrong and wicked worm called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and\\r\\ncame south. The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the\\r\\nNorth, and the pine-trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in the wind.\\r\\n\\x0cSome of the dwarves who happened to be outside (I was one luckily\\xe2\\x80\\x94a fine\\r\\nadventurous lad in those days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that\\r\\nday)\\xe2\\x80\\x94well, from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a\\r\\nspout of flame. Then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods\\r\\nthey all went up in fire. By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the\\r\\nwarriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was\\r\\nthe dragon waiting for them. None escaped that way. The river rushed up in\\r\\nsteam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the dragon came on them and\\r\\ndestroyed most of the warriors\\xe2\\x80\\x94the usual unhappy story, it was only too\\r\\ncommon in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate\\r\\nand routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and\\r\\npassages. After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their\\r\\nwealth for himself. Probably, for that is the dragons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 way, he has piled it all up in\\r\\na great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to crawl out of\\r\\nthe great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially\\r\\nmaidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone. What\\r\\ngoes on there now I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know for certain, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose any one lives\\r\\nnearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed\\r\\nSmaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather\\r\\nwith singed beards. They looked very grim but they said very little. When I\\r\\nasked how they had got away, they told me to hold my tongue, and said that one\\r\\nday in the proper time I should know. After that we went away, and we have had\\r\\nto earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands, often enough sinking\\r\\nas low as blacksmith-work or even coalmining. But we have never forgotten our\\r\\nstolen treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and\\r\\nare not so badly off\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his neck\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\r\\nstill mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug\\xe2\\x80\\x94if we can.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have often wondered about my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and my grandfather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s escape. I see\\r\\nnow they must have had a private Side-door which only they knew about. But\\r\\napparently they made a map, and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of\\r\\nit, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not \\xe2\\x80\\x98get hold of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I was given it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour grandfather\\r\\nThror was killed, you remember, in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCurse his name, yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd Thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of April, a hundred\\r\\nyears ago last Thursday, and has never been seen by you since\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrue, true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, your father gave me this to give to you; and if I have chosen my own\\r\\ntime and way for handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the\\r\\ntrouble I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he\\r\\ngave me the paper, and he never told me yours; so on the whole I think I ought to\\r\\nbe praised and thanked! Here it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he handing the map to Thorin.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say\\r\\nthe same. The explanation did not seem to explain.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour grandfather,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard slowly and grimly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgave the map to his\\r\\nson for safety before he went to the mines of Moria. Your father went away to\\r\\ntry his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed; and lots of\\r\\nadventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near the Mountain.\\r\\nHow he got there I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, but I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the\\r\\nNecromancer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever were you doing there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Thorin with a shudder, and all the\\r\\ndwarves shivered.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous\\r\\nbusiness it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father,\\r\\nbut it was too late. He was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost\\r\\neverything except the map and the key.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have long ago paid the goblins of Moria,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe must give a\\r\\nthought to the Necromancer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be absurd! He is an enemy far beyond the powers of all the dwarves\\r\\nput together, if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the\\r\\nworld. The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use\\r\\nthe key. The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHear, hear!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, and accidentally said it aloud.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHear what?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they all said turning suddenly towards him, and he was so\\r\\nflustered that he answered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHear what I have got to say!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they asked.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round. After all\\r\\nthere is the Side-door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose. If you sit\\r\\non the door-step long enough, I daresay you will think of something. And well,\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you know, I think we have talked long enough for one night, if you see\\r\\nwhat I mean. What about bed, and an early start, and all that? I will give you a\\r\\ngood breakfast before you go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBefore we go, I suppose you mean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you the burglar?\\r\\n\\x0cAnd isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sitting on the door-step your job, not to speak of getting inside the\\r\\ndoor? But I agree about bed and breakfast. I like six eggs with my ham, when\\r\\nstarting on a journey: fried not poached, and mind you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t break \\xe2\\x80\\x99em.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    After all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please\\r\\n(which annoyed Bilbo very much), they all got up. The hobbit had to find room\\r\\nfor them all, and filled all his spare-rooms and made beds on chairs and sofas,\\r\\nbefore he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not\\r\\naltogether happy. One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to\\r\\nget up very early and cook everybody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wretched breakfast. The\\r\\nTookishness was wearing off, and he was not now quite so sure that he was\\r\\ngoing on any journey in the morning.\\r\\n    As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best\\r\\nbedroom next to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Far over the misty mountains cold\\r\\n       To dungeons deep and caverns old\\r\\n       We must away, ere break of day,\\r\\n       To find our long-forgotten gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable\\r\\ndreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter II\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nROAST MUTTON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUp jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room.\\r\\nThere he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There\\r\\nwas a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen.\\r\\nNearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The washing-\\r\\nup was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night\\r\\nbefore had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he\\r\\nwas really relieved after all to think that they had all gone without him, and\\r\\nwithout bothering to wake him up (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut with never a thank-you\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought);\\r\\nand yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling\\r\\nsurprised him.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthinking of dragons\\r\\nand all that outlandish nonsense at your age!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So he put on an apron, lit fires,\\r\\nboiled water, and washed up. Then he had a nice little breakfast in the kitchen\\r\\nbefore turning out the dining-room. By that time the sun was shining; and the\\r\\nfront door was open, letting in a warm spring breeze. Bilbo began to whistle\\r\\nloudly and to forget about the night before. In fact he was just sitting down to a\\r\\nnice little second breakfast in the dining-room by the open window, when in\\r\\nwalked Gandalf.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear fellow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhenever are you going to come? What about an\\r\\nearly start?\\xe2\\x80\\x94and here you are having breakfast, or whatever you call it, at half\\r\\npast ten! They left you the message, because they could not wait.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat message?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said poor Mr. Baggins all in a fluster.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreat Elephants!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are not at all yourself this morning\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nyou have never dusted the mantelpiece!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that got to do with it? I have had enough to do with washing up for\\r\\n\\x0cfourteen!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you had dusted the mantelpiece, you would have found this just under the\\r\\nclock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, handing Bilbo a note (written, of course, on his own note-\\r\\npaper).\\r\\n   This is what he read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! For your hospitality our\\r\\nsincerest thanks, and for your offer of professional assistance our grateful\\r\\nacceptance. Terms: cash on delivery, up to and not exceeding one fourteenth of\\r\\ntotal profits (if any); all travelling expenses guaranteed in any event; funeral\\r\\nexpenses to be defrayed by us or our representatives, if occasion arises and the\\r\\nmatter is not otherwise arranged for.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose, we have\\r\\nproceeded in advance to make requisite preparations, and shall await your\\r\\nrespected person at the Green Dragon Inn, Bywater, at 11 a.m. sharp. Trusting\\r\\nthat you will be punctual,\\r\\n        \\xe2\\x80\\x9c We have the honour to remain\\r\\n           \\xe2\\x80\\x9c Yours deeply\\r\\n                \\xe2\\x80\\x9c Thorin & Co.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat leaves you just ten minutes. You will have to run,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut\\xe2\\x80\\x94,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo time for it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut\\xe2\\x80\\x94,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo again.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo time for that either! Off you go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    To the end of his days Bilbo could never remember how he found himself\\r\\noutside, without a hat, a walking-stick or any money, or anything that he usually\\r\\ntook when he went out; leaving his second breakfast half-finished and quite\\r\\nunwashed-up, pushing his keys into Gandalf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands, and running as fast as his\\r\\nfurry feet could carry him down the lane, past the great Mill, across The Water,\\r\\nand then on for a mile or more.\\r\\n    Very puffed he was, when he got to Bywater just on the stroke of eleven, and\\r\\nfound he had come without a pocket-handkerchief!\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBravo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him.\\r\\n    Just then all the others came round the corner of the road from the village.\\r\\nThey were on ponies, and each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages,\\r\\npackages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently\\r\\n\\x0cfor Bilbo.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUp you two get, and off we go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m awfully sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I have come without my hat, and I have\\r\\nleft my pocket-handkerchief behind, and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got any money. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get\\r\\nyour note until after 10.45 to be precise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be precise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dwalin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry! You will have to manage\\r\\nwithout pocket-handkerchiefs, and a good many other things, before you get to\\r\\nthe journey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end. As for a hat, I have got a spare hood and cloak in my\\r\\nluggage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how they all came to start, jogging off from the inn one fine morning\\r\\njust before May, on laden ponies; and Bilbo was wearing a dark-green hood (a\\r\\nlittle weather-stained) and a dark-green cloak borrowed from Dwalin. They were\\r\\ntoo large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his father Bungo would\\r\\nhave thought of him, I daren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think. His only comfort was he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nmistaken for a dwarf, as he had no beard.\\r\\n     They had not been riding very long, when up came Gandalf very splendid on\\r\\na white horse. He had brought a lot of pocket-handkerchiefs, and Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pipe\\r\\nand tobacco. So after that the party went along very merrily, and they told stories\\r\\nor sang songs as they rode forward all day, except of course when they stopped\\r\\nfor meals. These didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them, but\\r\\nstill he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.\\r\\n     At first they had passed through hobbit-lands, a wide respectable country\\r\\ninhabited by decent folk, with good roads, an inn or two, and now and then a\\r\\ndwarf or a farmer ambling by on business. Then they came to lands where\\r\\npeople spoke strangely, and sang songs Bilbo had never heard before. Now they\\r\\nhad gone on far into the Lone-lands, where there were no people left, no inns,\\r\\nand the roads grew steadily worse. Not far ahead were dreary hills, rising higher\\r\\nand higher, dark with trees. On some of them were old castles with an evil look,\\r\\nas if they had been built by wicked people. Everything seemed gloomy, for the\\r\\nweather that day had taken a nasty turn. Mostly it had been as good as May can\\r\\nbe, can be, even in merry tales, but now it was cold and wet. In the Lone-lands\\r\\nthey had been obliged to camp when they could, but at least it had been dry.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo think it will soon be June!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grumbled Bilbo, as he splashed along behind\\r\\nthe others in a very muddy track. It was after tea-time; it was pouring with rain,\\r\\nand had been all day; his hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was full of\\r\\nwater; the pony was tired and stumbled on stones; the others were too grumpy to\\r\\ntalk. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure the rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food-bags,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0cthought Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBother burgling and everything to do with it! I wish I was at\\r\\nhome in my nice hole by the fire, with the kettle just beginning to sing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was\\r\\nnot the last time that he wished that!\\r\\n    Still the dwarves jogged on, never turning round or taking any notice of the\\r\\nhobbit. Somewhere behind the grey clouds the sun must have gone down, for it\\r\\nbegan to get dark as they went down into a deep valley with a river at the\\r\\nbottom. Wind got up, and willows along its banks bent and sighed. Fortunately\\r\\nthe road went over an ancient stone bridge, for the river, swollen with the rains,\\r\\ncame rushing down from the hills and mountains in the north.\\r\\n    It was nearly night when they had crossed over. The wind broke up the grey\\r\\nclouds, and a wandering moon appeared above the hills between the flying rags.\\r\\nThen they stopped, and Thorin muttered something about supper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand where\\r\\nshall we get a dry patch to sleep on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Not until then did they notice that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come\\r\\nall the way with them, never saying if he was in the adventure or merely keeping\\r\\nthem company for a while. He had eaten most, talked most, and laughed most.\\r\\nBut now he simply was not there at all!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust when a wizard would have been most useful, too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d groaned Dori and\\r\\nNori (who shared the hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s views about regular meals, plenty and often).\\r\\n    They decided in the end that they would have to camp where they were. They\\r\\nmoved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook\\r\\nthe rain off the leaves, and the drip, drip, was most annoying. Also the mischief\\r\\nseemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out\\r\\nof almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that night, not even\\r\\nOin and Gloin, who were specially good at it.\\r\\n    Then one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted. He got into the river\\r\\nbefore they could catch him; and before they could get him out again, Fili and\\r\\nKili were nearly drowned, and all the baggage that he carried was washed away\\r\\noff him. Of course it was mostly food, and there was mighty little left for supper,\\r\\nand less for breakfast.\\r\\n    There they all sat glum and wet and muttering, while Oin and Gloin went on\\r\\ntrying to light the fire, and quarrelling about it. Bilbo was sadly reflecting that\\r\\nadventures are not all pony-rides in May-sunshine, when Balin, who was always\\r\\ntheir look-out man, said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a light over there!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There was a hill some way\\r\\noff with trees on it, pretty thick in parts. Out of the dark mass of the trees they\\r\\n\\x0ccould now see a light shining, a reddish comfortable-looking light, as it might be\\r\\na fire or torches twinkling.\\r\\n    When they had looked at it for some while, they fell to arguing. Some said\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cno\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and some said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Some said they could but go and see, and anything\\r\\nwas better than little supper, less breakfast, and wet clothes all the night.\\r\\n    Others said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese parts are none too well known, and are too near the\\r\\nmountains. Travellers seldom come this way now. The old maps are no use:\\r\\nthings have changed for the worse and the road is unguarded. They have seldom\\r\\neven heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as you go\\r\\nalong, the less trouble you are likely to find.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter all there are\\r\\nfourteen of us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Others said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere has Gandalf got to?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This remark was\\r\\nrepeated by everybody. Then the rain began to pour down worse than ever, and\\r\\nOin and Gloin began to fight.\\r\\n    That settled it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter all we have got a burglar with us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said; and so\\r\\nthey made off, leading their ponies (with all due and proper caution) in the\\r\\ndirection of the light. They came to the hill and were soon in the wood. Up the\\r\\nhill they went; but there was no proper path to be seen, such as might lead to a\\r\\nhouse or a farm; and do what they could they made a deal of rustling and\\r\\ncrackling and creaking (and a good deal of grumbling and dratting), as they went\\r\\nthrough the trees in the pitch dark.\\r\\n    Suddenly the red light shone out very bright through the tree-trunks not far\\r\\nahead.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow it is the burglar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said, meaning Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must go on and\\r\\nfind out all about that light, and what it is for, and if all is perfectly safe and\\r\\ncanny,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin to the hobbit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow scuttle off, and come back quick, if all\\r\\nis well. If not, come back if you can! If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, hoot twice like a barn-owl and\\r\\nonce like a screech-owl, and we will do what we can.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Off Bilbo had to go, before he could explain that he could not hoot even once\\r\\nlike any kind of owl any more than fly like a bat. But at any rate hobbits can\\r\\nmove quietly in woods, absolutely quietly. They take a pride in it, and Bilbo had\\r\\nsniffed more than once at what he called \\xe2\\x80\\x9call this dwarvish racket,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as they went\\r\\nalong, though I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose you or I would have noticed anything at all on a\\r\\nwindy night, not if the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off. As for Bilbo\\r\\nwalking primly towards the red light, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose even a weasel would have\\r\\nstirred a whisker at it. So, naturally, he got right up to the fire\\xe2\\x80\\x94for fire it was\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nwithout disturbing anyone. And this is what he saw.\\r\\n    Three very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beech-logs. They\\r\\n\\x0cwere toasting mutton on long spits of wood, and licking the gravy off their\\r\\nfingers. There was a fine toothsome smell. Also there was a barrel of good drink\\r\\nat hand, and they were drinking out of jugs. But they were trolls. Obviously\\r\\ntrolls. Even Bilbo, in spite of his sheltered life, could see that: from the great\\r\\nheavy faces of them, and their size, and the shape of their legs, not to mention\\r\\ntheir language, which was not drawing-room fashion at all, at all.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMutton yesterday, mutton today, and blimey, if it don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look like mutton\\r\\nagain tomorrer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the trolls.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever a blinking bit of manflesh have we had for long enough,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a\\r\\nsecond. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat the \\xe2\\x80\\x99ell William was a-thinkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of to bring us into these parts at\\r\\nall, beats me\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the drink runnin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 short, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said jogging the\\r\\nelbow of William, who was taking a pull at his jug.\\r\\n    William choked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShut yer mouth!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said as soon as he could. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYer can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nexpect folk to stop here for ever just to be et by you and Bert. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve et a village\\r\\nand a half between yer, since we come down from the mountains. How much\\r\\nmore d\\xe2\\x80\\x99yer want? And time\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been up our way, when yer\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have said \\xe2\\x80\\x98thank yer\\r\\nBill\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for a nice bit o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fat valley mutton like what this is.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He took a big bite off a\\r\\nsheep\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leg he was roasting, and wiped his lips on his sleeve.\\r\\n    Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head\\r\\neach. After hearing all this Bilbo ought to have done something at once. Either\\r\\nhe should have gone back quietly and warned his friends that there were three\\r\\nfair-sized trolls at hand in a nasty mood, quite likely to try roasted dwarf, or even\\r\\npony, for a change; or else he should have done a bit of good quick burgling. A\\r\\nreally first-class and legendary burglar would at this point have picked the trolls\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\npockets\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is nearly always worth while, if you can manage it\\xe2\\x80\\x94, pinched the\\r\\nvery mutton off the spits, purloined the beer, and walked off without their\\r\\nnoticing him. Others more practical but with less professional pride would\\r\\nperhaps have stuck a dagger into each of them before they observed it. Then the\\r\\nnight could have been spent cheerily.\\r\\n    Bilbo knew it. He had read of a good many things he had never seen or done.\\r\\nHe was very much alarmed, as well as disgusted; he wished himself a hundred\\r\\nmiles away, and yet\\xe2\\x80\\x94and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin\\r\\nand Company emptyhanded. So he stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the\\r\\nvarious burglarious proceedings he had heard of picking the trolls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pockets\\r\\nseemed the least difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William.\\r\\n    Bert and Tom went off to the barrel. William was having another drink. Then\\r\\nBilbo plucked up courage and put his little hand in William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enormous pocket.\\r\\n\\x0cThere was a purse in it, as big as a bag to Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHa!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought he, warming to\\r\\nhis new work as he lifted it carefully out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is a beginning!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    It was! Trolls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Ere, \\xe2\\x80\\x99oo\\r\\nare you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it squeaked, as it left the pocket; and William turned round at once and\\r\\ngrabbed Bilbo by the neck, before he could duck behind the tree.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlimey, Bert, look what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve copped!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the others coming up.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLumme, if I knows! What are yer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBilbo Baggins, a bur\\xe2\\x80\\x94a hobbit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said poor Bilbo, shaking all over, and\\r\\nwondering how to make owl-noises before they throttled him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA burrahobbit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said they a bit startled. Trolls are slow in the uptake, and\\r\\nmighty suspicious about anything new to them.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd can yer cook \\xe2\\x80\\x99em?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYer can try,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert, picking up a skewer.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make above a mouthful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William, who had already had a\\r\\nfine supper, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot when he was skinned and boned.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cP\\xe2\\x80\\x99raps there are more like him round about, and we might make a pie,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nBert. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere you, are there any more of your sort a-sneakin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in these here woods,\\r\\nyer nassty little rabbit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he looking at the hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s furry feet; and he picked\\r\\nhim up by the toes and shook him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, lots,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, before he remembered not to give his friends away.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo none at all, not one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said immediately afterwards.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat d\\xe2\\x80\\x99yer mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert, holding him right way up, by the hair this\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat I say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo gasping. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd please don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cook me, kind sirs! I am\\r\\na good cook myself, and cook better than I cook, if you see what I mean. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\ncook beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have me for supper.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor little blighter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William. He had already had as much supper as he\\r\\ncould hold; also he had had lots of beer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor little blighter! Let him go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot till he says what he means by lots and none at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nwant to have me throat cut in me sleep! Hold his toes in the fire, till he talks!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI caught him anyway.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a fat fool, William,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said afore this evening.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a lout!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take that from you, Bill Huggins,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Bert, and puts his fist in\\r\\n\\x0cWilliam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye.\\r\\n    Then there was a gorgeous row. Bilbo had just enough wits left, when Bert\\r\\ndropped him on the ground, to scramble out of the way of their feet, before they\\r\\nwere fighting like dogs, and calling one another all sorts of perfectly true and\\r\\napplicable names in very loud voices. Soon they were locked in one another\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\narms, and rolling nearly into the fire kicking and thumping, while Tom whacked\\r\\nat them both with a branch to bring them to their senses\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that of course only\\r\\nmade them madder than ever.\\r\\n    That would have been the time for Bilbo to have left. But his poor little feet\\r\\nhad been very squashed in Bert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s big paw, and he had no breath in his body, and\\r\\nhis head was going round; so there he lay for a while panting, just outside the\\r\\ncircle of firelight.\\r\\n    Right in the middle of the fight up came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises\\r\\nfrom a distance, and after waiting for some time for Bilbo to come back, or to\\r\\nhoot like an owl, they started off one by one to creep towards the light as quietly\\r\\nas they could. No sooner did Tom see Balin come into the light than he gave an\\r\\nawful howl. Trolls simply detest the very sight of dwarves (uncooked). Bert and\\r\\nBill stopped fighting immediately, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca sack, Tom, quick!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said. Before\\r\\nBalin, who was wondering where in all this commotion Bilbo was, knew what\\r\\nwas happening, a sack was over his head, and he was down.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more to come yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m mighty mistook. Lots and\\r\\nnone at all, it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo burrahobbits, but lots of these here dwarves.\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about the shape of it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI reckon you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d best get out of the light.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    And so they did. With sacks in their hands, that they used for carrying off\\r\\nmutton and other plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each dwarf came up\\r\\nand looked at the fire, and the spilled jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in surprise,\\r\\npop! went a nasty smelly sack over his head, and he was down. Soon Dwalin lay\\r\\nby Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap, and\\r\\nOin and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the\\r\\nfire.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll teach \\xe2\\x80\\x99em,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of\\r\\ntrouble, and fought like mad, as dwarves will when cornered.\\r\\n    Thorin came last\\xe2\\x80\\x94and he was not caught unawares. He came expecting\\r\\nmischief, and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to see his friends\\xe2\\x80\\x99 legs sticking out of sacks to tell him\\r\\nthat things were not all well. He stood outside in the shadows some way off, and\\r\\nsaid: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all this trouble? Who has been knocking my people about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trolls!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo from behind a tree. They had forgotten all about him.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hiding in the bushes with sacks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO! are they?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, and he jumped forward to the fire, before they\\r\\ncould leap on him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one end; and Bert got\\r\\nthat end in his eye before he could step aside. That put him out of the battle for a\\r\\nbit. Bilbo did his best. He caught hold of Tom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leg\\xe2\\x80\\x94as well as he could, it was\\r\\nthick as a young tree-trunk\\xe2\\x80\\x94but he was sent spinning up into the top of some\\r\\nbushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face.\\r\\n\\x0cThe Trolls\\r\\n\\x0c    Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It\\r\\nmade him howl, I can tell you. But just at that moment William came up behind\\r\\nand popped a sack right over Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head and down to his toes. And so the\\r\\nfight ended. A nice pickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in sacks, with\\r\\nthree angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them,\\r\\narguing whether they should roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil\\r\\nthem, or just sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly; and Bilbo up in\\r\\na bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not daring to move for fear they should\\r\\nhear him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was just then that Gandalf came back. But no one saw him. The trolls had just\\r\\ndecided to roast the dwarves now and eat them later\\xe2\\x80\\x94that was Bert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s idea, and\\r\\nafter a lot of argument they had all agreed to it.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo good roasting \\xe2\\x80\\x99em now, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d take all night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a voice. Bert thought it\\r\\nwas William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start the argument all over again, Bill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor it will take all\\r\\nnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a-arguing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William, who thought it was Bert that had spoken.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a liar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William; and so the argument began all over again. In\\r\\nthe end they decided to mince them fine and boil them. So they got a great black\\r\\npot, and they took out their knives.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo good boiling \\xe2\\x80\\x99em! We ain\\xe2\\x80\\x99t got no water, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a long way to the well\\r\\nand all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a voice. Bert and William thought it was Tom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShut up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said they, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never have done. And yer can fetch the water\\r\\nyerself, if yer say any more.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShut up yerself!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom, who thought it was William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\narguing but you, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a booby,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBooby yerself!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom.\\r\\n    And so the argument began all over again, and went on hotter than ever, until\\r\\nat last they decided to sit on the sacks one by one and squash them, and boil\\r\\nthem next time.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho shall we sit on first?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the voice.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter sit on the last fellow first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert, whose eye had been damaged\\r\\nby Thorin. He thought Tom was talking.\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk to yerself!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if you wants to sit on the last one, sit\\r\\non him. Which is he?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe one with the yellow stockings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsense, the one with the grey stockings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a voice like William\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI made sure it was yellow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYellow it was,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen what did yer say it was grey for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never did. Tom said it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat I never did!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo to one, so shut yer mouth!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bert.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you a-talkin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said William.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow stop it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tom and Bert together. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gettin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on, and dawn\\r\\ncomes early. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get on with it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDawn take you all, and be stone to you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a voice that sounded like\\r\\nWilliam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. But it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. For just at that moment the light came over the hill, and\\r\\nthere was a mighty twitter in the branches. William never spoke for he stood\\r\\nturned to stone as he stooped; and Bert and Tom were stuck like rocks as they\\r\\nlooked at him. And there they stand to this day, all alone, unless the birds perch\\r\\non them; for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or\\r\\nthey go back to the stuff of the mountains they are made of, and never move\\r\\nagain. That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and William.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcellent!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, as he stepped from behind a tree, and helped Bilbo\\r\\nto climb down out of a thorn-bush. Then Bilbo understood. It was the wizard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nvoice that had kept the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the light came and\\r\\nmade an end of them.\\r\\n    The next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves. They were\\r\\nnearly suffocated, and very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed lying there\\r\\nlistening to the trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them and\\r\\nmincing them. They had to hear Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account of what had happened to him\\r\\ntwice over, before they were satisfied.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bombur,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen what we wanted was fire and food!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just what you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have got of those fellows without a\\r\\nstruggle, in any case,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnyhow you are wasting time now. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou realize that the trolls must have a cave or a hole dug somewhere near to hide\\r\\nfrom the sun in? We must look into it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    They searched about, and soon found the marks of trolls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 stony boots going\\r\\n\\x0caway through the trees. They followed the tracks up the hill, until hidden by\\r\\nbushes they came on a big door of stone leading to a cave. But they could not\\r\\nopen it, not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various incantations.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould this be any good?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo, when they were getting tired and\\r\\nangry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI found it on the ground where the trolls had their fight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He held out a\\r\\nlargish key, though no doubt William had thought it very small and secret. It\\r\\nmust have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, before he was turned to stone.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy on earth didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you mention it before?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried. Gandalf grabbed it\\r\\nand fitted it into the keyhole. Then the stone door swung back with one big push,\\r\\nand they all went inside. There were bones on the floor and a nasty smell was in\\r\\nthe air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on\\r\\nthe ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all sorts from brass buttons to\\r\\npots full of gold coins standing in a corner. There were lots of clothes, too,\\r\\nhanging on the walls\\xe2\\x80\\x94too small for trolls, I am afraid they belonged to victims\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94and among them were several swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes.\\r\\nTwo caught their eyes particularly, because of their beautiful scabbards and\\r\\njewelled hilts.\\r\\n    Gandalf and Thorin each took one of these; and Bilbo took a knife in a\\r\\nleather sheath. It would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was\\r\\nas good as a short sword for the hobbit.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese look like good blades,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard, half drawing them and\\r\\nlooking at them curiously. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey were not made by any troll, nor by any smith\\r\\namong men in these parts and days; but when we can read the runes on them, we\\r\\nshall know more about them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get out of this horrible smell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fili. So they carried out the pots of\\r\\ncoins, and such food as was untouched and looked fit to eat, also one barrel of\\r\\nale which was still full. By that time they felt like breakfast, and being very\\r\\nhungry they did not turn their noses up at what they had got from the trolls\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nlarder. Their own provisions were very scanty. Now they had bread and cheese,\\r\\nand plenty of ale, and bacon to toast in the embers of the fire.\\r\\n    After that they slept, for their night had been disturbed; and they did nothing\\r\\nmore till the afternoon. Then they brought up their ponies, and carried away the\\r\\npots of gold, and buried them very secretly not far from the track by the river,\\r\\nputting a great many spells over them, just in case they ever had the chance to\\r\\ncome back and recover them. When that was done, they all mounted once more,\\r\\nand jogged along again on the path towards the East.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere did you go to, if I may ask?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin to Gandalf as they rode\\r\\n\\x0calong.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo look ahead,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what brought you back in the nick of time?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooking behind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExactly!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut could you be more plain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI went on to spy out our road. It will soon become dangerous and difficult.\\r\\nAlso I was anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions. I had not\\r\\ngone very far, however, when I met a couple of friends of mine from Rivendell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interrupt!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will get there in a few days now, if\\r\\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lucky, and find out all about it. As I was saying I met two of Elrond\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\npeople. They were hurrying along for fear of the trolls. It was they who told me\\r\\nthat three of them had come down from the mountains and settled in the woods\\r\\nnot far from the road: they had frightened everyone away from the district, and\\r\\nthey waylaid strangers.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI immediately had a feeling that I was wanted back. Looking behind I saw a\\r\\nfire in the distance and made for it. So now you know. Please be more careful,\\r\\nnext time, or we shall never get anywhere!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter III\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA SHORT REST\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not sing or tell stories that day, even though the weather improved; nor\\r\\nthe next day, nor the day after. They had begun to feel that danger was not far\\r\\naway on either side. They camped under the stars, and their horses had more to\\r\\neat than they had; for there was plenty of grass, but there was not much in their\\r\\nbags, even with what they had got from the trolls. One morning they forded a\\r\\nriver at a wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam. The far bank\\r\\nwas steep and slippery. When they got to the top of it, leading their ponies, they\\r\\nsaw that the great mountains had marched down very near to them. Already they\\r\\nseemed only a day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy journey from the feet of the nearest. Dark and drear it\\r\\nlooked, though there were patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and behind its\\r\\nshoulders the tips of snow-peaks gleamed.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that The Mountain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo in a solemn voice, looking at it with\\r\\nround eyes. He had never seen a thing that looked so big before.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course not!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is only the beginning of the Misty\\r\\nMountains, and we have got to get through, or over, or under those somehow,\\r\\nbefore we can come into Wilderland beyond. And it is a deal of a way even from\\r\\nthe other side of them to the Lonely Mountain in the East where Smaug lies on\\r\\nour treasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, and just at that moment he felt more tired than he ever\\r\\nremembered feeling before. He was thinking once again of his comfortable chair\\r\\nbefore the fire in his favourite sitting-room in his hobbit-hole, and of the kettle\\r\\nsinging. Not for the last time!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Gandalf led the way. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must not miss the road, or we shall be done for,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0che said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safety\\xe2\\x80\\x94also it is\\r\\nvery necessary to tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper path, or else you will\\r\\nget lost in them, and have to come back and start at the beginning again (if you\\r\\never get back at all).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    They asked him where he was making for, and he answered: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are come\\r\\nto the very edge of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere\\r\\nahead of us is the fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond lives in the Last Homely\\r\\nHouse. I sent a message by my friends, and we are expected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    That sounded nice and comforting, but they had not got there yet, and it was\\r\\nnot so easy as it sounds to find the Last Homely House west of the Mountains.\\r\\nThere seemed to be no trees and no valleys and no hills to break the ground in\\r\\nfront of them, only one vast slope going slowly up and up to meet the feet of the\\r\\nnearest mountain, a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with\\r\\npatches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n    Morning passed, afternoon came; but in all the silent waste there was no sign\\r\\nof any dwelling. They were growing anxious, for they saw now that the house\\r\\nmight be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains. They came\\r\\non unexpected valleys, narrow with steep sides, that opened suddenly at their\\r\\nfeet, and they looked down surprised to see trees below them and running water\\r\\nat the bottom. There were gullies that they could almost leap over, but very deep\\r\\nwith waterfalls in them. There were dark ravines that one could neither jump\\r\\nover nor climb into. There were bogs, some of them green pleasant places to\\r\\nlook at, with flowers growing bright and tall; but a pony that walked there with a\\r\\npack on its back would never have come out again.\\r\\n    It was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever\\r\\nyou would have guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with\\r\\nwhite stones, some of which were small, and others were half covered with moss\\r\\nor heather. Altogether it was a very slow business following the track, even\\r\\nguided by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well.\\r\\n    His head and beard wagged this way and that as he looked for the stones, and\\r\\nthey followed his lead, but they seemed no nearer to the end of the search when\\r\\nthe day began to fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed supper-time\\r\\nwould soon do the same. There were moths fluttering about, and the light\\r\\nbecame very dim, for the moon had not risen. Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pony began to stumble\\r\\nover roots and stones. They came to the edge of a steep fall in the ground so\\r\\nsuddenly that Gandalf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horse nearly slipped down the slope.\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere it is at last!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called, and the others gathered round him and looked\\r\\nover the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear the voice of\\r\\nhurrying water in a rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and\\r\\nthere was a light on the valley-side across the water.\\r\\n    Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered and slipped in the dusk down the\\r\\nsteep zig-zag path into the secret valley of Rivendell. The air grew warmer as\\r\\nthey got lower, and the smell of the pine-trees made him drowsy, so that every\\r\\nnow and again he nodded and nearly fell off, or bumped his nose on the pony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nneck. Their spirits rose as they went down and down. The trees changed to beech\\r\\nand oak, and there was a comfortable feeling in the twilight. The last green had\\r\\nalmost faded out of the grass, when they came at length to an open glade not far\\r\\nabove the banks of the stream.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHmmm! it smells like elves!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Bilbo, and he looked up at the stars.\\r\\nThey were burning bright and blue. Just then there came a burst of song like\\r\\nlaughter in the trees:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       O! What are you doing,\\r\\n       And where are you going?\\r\\n       Your ponies need shoeing!\\r\\n       The river is flowing!\\r\\n         O! tra-la-la-lally\\r\\n            here down in the valley!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       O! What are you seeking,\\r\\n       And where are you making?\\r\\n       The faggots are reeking,\\r\\n       The bannocks are baking!\\r\\n         O! tril-lil-lil-lolly\\r\\n            the valley is jolly,\\r\\n               ha! ha!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       O! Where are you going\\r\\n       With beards all a-wagging?\\r\\n       No knowing, no knowing\\r\\n       What brings Mister Baggins\\r\\n\\x0c          And Balin and Dwalin\\r\\n            down into the valley\\r\\n              in June\\r\\n                 ha! ha!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n        O! Will you be staying,\\r\\n        Or will you be flying?\\r\\n        Your ponies are straying!\\r\\n        The daylight is dying!\\r\\n        To fly would be folly,\\r\\n        To stay would be jolly\\r\\n          And listen and hark\\r\\n              Till the end of the dark\\r\\n                 to our tune\\r\\n                    ha! ha!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     So they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense I daresay you\\r\\nthink it. Not that they would care; they would only laugh all the more if you told\\r\\nthem so. They were elves of course. Soon Bilbo caught glimpses of them as the\\r\\ndarkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a\\r\\nlittle frightened of them too. Dwarves don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get on well with them. Even decent\\r\\nenough dwarves like Thorin and his friends think them foolish (which is a very\\r\\nfoolish thing to think), or get annoyed with them. For some elves tease them and\\r\\nlaugh at them, and most of all at their beards.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJust look! Bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear!\\r\\nIsn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it delicious!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost astonishing wonderful!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     Then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written\\r\\ndown in full. At last one, a tall young fellow, came out from the trees and bowed\\r\\nto Gandalf and to Thorin.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWelcome to the valley!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off his horse\\r\\nand among the elves, talking merrily with them.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are a little out of your way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the elf: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is, if you are making for\\r\\nthe only path across the water and to the house beyond. We will set you right,\\r\\nbut you had best get on foot, until you are over the bridge. Are you going to stay\\r\\n\\x0ca bit and sing with us, or will you go straight on? Supper is preparing over\\r\\nthere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can smell the wood-fires for the cooking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay a while. Elvish singing is not\\r\\na thing to miss, in June under the stars, not if you care for such things. Also he\\r\\nwould have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to\\r\\nknow his names and all about him, although he had never seen them before. He\\r\\nthought their opinion of his adventure might be interesting. Elves know a lot and\\r\\nare wondrous folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of\\r\\nthe land, as quick as water flows, or quicker.\\r\\n    But the dwarves were all for supper as soon as possible just then, and would\\r\\nnot stay. On they all went, leading their ponies, till they were brought to a good\\r\\npath and so at last to the very brink of the river. It was flowing fast and noisily,\\r\\nas mountain-streams do of a summer evening, when sun has been all day on the\\r\\nsnow far up above. There was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet,\\r\\nas narrow as a pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and\\r\\ncareful, one by one, each leading his pony by the bridle. The elves had brought\\r\\nbright lanterns to the shore, and they sang a merry song as the party went across.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t dip your beard in the foam, father!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried to Thorin, who was\\r\\nbent almost on to his hands and knees. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is long enough without watering it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMind Bilbo doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t eat all the cakes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they called. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is too fat to get\\r\\nthrough key-holes yet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHush, hush! Good People! and good night!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, who came last.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cValleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. Good night!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    And so at last they all came to the Last Homely House, and found its doors\\r\\nflung wide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are\\r\\ngood to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that\\r\\nare uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and\\r\\ntake a deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good house, fourteen days\\r\\nat least, and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would gladly have stopped there\\r\\nfor ever and ever\\xe2\\x80\\x94even supposing a wish would have taken him right back to\\r\\nhis hobbit-hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay.\\r\\n    The master of the house was an elf-friend\\xe2\\x80\\x94one of those people whose\\r\\nfathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of\\r\\nthe evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our\\r\\n\\x0ctale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for\\r\\nancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief.\\r\\n    He was as noble and as fair in face as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as\\r\\nwise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer. He\\r\\ncomes into many tales, but his part in the story of Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great adventure is only\\r\\na small one, though important, as you will see, if we ever get to the end of it. His\\r\\nhouse was perfect, whether you liked food, or sleep, or work, or story-telling, or\\r\\nsinging, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all. Evil\\r\\nthings did not come into that valley.\\r\\n    I wish I had time to tell you even a few of the tales or one or two of the songs\\r\\nthat they heard in that house. All of them, the ponies as well, grew refreshed and\\r\\nstrong in a few days there. Their clothes were mended as well as their bruises,\\r\\ntheir tempers and their hopes. Their bags were filled with food and provisions\\r\\nlight to carry but strong to bring them over the mountain passes. Their plans\\r\\nwere improved with the best advice. So the time came to midsummer eve, and\\r\\nthey were to go on again with the early sun on midsummer morning.\\r\\n    Elrond knew all about runes of every kind. That day he looked at the swords\\r\\nthey had brought from the trolls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lair, and he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are not troll-make.\\r\\nThey are old swords, very old swords of the High Elves of the West, my kin.\\r\\nThey were made in Gondolin for the Goblin-wars. They must have come from a\\r\\ndragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hoard or goblin plunder, for dragons and goblins destroyed that city\\r\\nmany ages ago. This, Thorin, the runes name Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver in the\\r\\nancient tongue of Gondolin; it was a famous blade. This, Gandalf, was\\r\\nGlamdring, Foe-hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore. Keep them well!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhence did the trolls get them, I wonder?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin looking at his sword\\r\\nwith new interest.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI could not say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elrond, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut one may guess that your trolls had\\r\\nplundered other plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some\\r\\nhold in the mountains. I have heard that there are still forgotten treasures of old\\r\\nto be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of Moria, since the dwarf and\\r\\ngoblin war.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Thorin pondered these words. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will keep this sword in honour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay it soon cleave goblins once again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nElrond. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut show me now your map!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    He took it and gazed long at it, and he shook his head; for if he did not\\r\\naltogether approve of dwarves and their love of gold, he hated dragons and their\\r\\n\\x0ccruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of Dale and\\r\\nits merry bells, and the burned banks of the bright River Running. The moon was\\r\\nshining in a broad silver crescent. He held up the map and the white light shone\\r\\nthrough it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is this?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are moon-letters here, beside the plain\\r\\nrunes which say \\xe2\\x80\\x98five feet high the door and three may walk abreast.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are moon-letters?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the hobbit full of excitement. He loved\\r\\nmaps, as I have told you before; and he also liked runes and letters and cunning\\r\\nhandwriting, though when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoon-letters are rune-letters, but you cannot see them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elrond, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot\\r\\nwhen you look straight at them. They can only be seen when the moon shines\\r\\nbehind them, and what is more, with the more cunning sort it must be a moon of\\r\\nthe same shape and season as the day when they were written. The dwarves\\r\\ninvented them and wrote them with silver pens, as your friends could tell you.\\r\\nThese must have been written on a midsummer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eve in a crescent moon, a long\\r\\nwhile ago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do they say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Gandalf and Thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps\\r\\nthat even Elrond should have found this out first, though really there had not\\r\\nbeen a chance before, and there would not have been another until goodness\\r\\nknows when.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d read Elrond, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand the\\r\\nsetting sun with the last light of Durin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day will shine upon the key-hole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDurin, Durin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was the father of the fathers of the eldest\\r\\nrace of Dwarves, the Longbeards, and my first ancestor: I am his heir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen what is Durin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Elrond.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe first day of the dwarves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 New Year,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis as all should know\\r\\nthe first day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter. We still call\\r\\nit Durin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day when the last moon of Autumn and the sun are in the sky\\r\\ntogether. But this will not help us much, I fear, for it passes our skill in these\\r\\ndays to guess when such a time will come again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat remains to be seen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs there any more writing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone to be seen by this moon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elrond, and he gave the map back to\\r\\nThorin; and then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing\\r\\nupon the midsummer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eve.\\r\\n    The next morning was a midsummer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s morning as fair and fresh as could be\\r\\ndreamed: blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. Now\\r\\nthey rode away amid songs of farewell and good speed, with their hearts ready\\r\\nfor more adventure, and with a knowledge of the road they must follow over the\\r\\n\\x0cMisty Mountains to the land beyond.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter IV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOVER HILL AND UNDER HILL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over\\r\\nthem. But most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to\\r\\nbad ends; and most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful\\r\\ndangers. The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of Elrond and\\r\\nthe knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass.\\r\\n    Long days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the Last Homely\\r\\nHouse miles behind, they were still going up and up and up. It was a hard path\\r\\nand a dangerous path, a crooked way and a lonely and a long. Now they could\\r\\nlook back over the lands they had left, laid out behind them far below. Far, far\\r\\naway in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay his\\r\\nown country of safe and comfortable things, and his little hobbit-hole. He\\r\\nshivered. It was getting bitter cold up here, and the wind came shrill among the\\r\\nrocks. Boulders, too, at times came galloping down the mountain-sides, let loose\\r\\nby mid-day sun upon the snow, and passed among them (which was lucky), or\\r\\nover their heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless and chill,\\r\\nand they did not dare to sing or talk too loud, for the echoes were uncanny, and\\r\\nthe silence seemed to dislike being broken\\xe2\\x80\\x94except by the noise of water and the\\r\\nwail of wind and the crack of stone.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe summer is getting on down below,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand haymaking is\\r\\ngoing on and picnics. They will be harvesting and blackberrying, before we even\\r\\nbegin to go down the other side at this rate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And the others were thinking\\r\\nequally gloomy thoughts, although when they had said good-bye to Elrond in the\\r\\nhigh hope of a midsummer morning, they had spoken gaily of the passage of the\\r\\nmountains, and of riding swift across the lands beyond. They had thought of\\r\\ncoming to the secret door in the Lonely Mountain, perhaps that very next last\\r\\n\\x0cmoon of Autumn\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand perhaps it will be Durin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Day\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they had said. Only\\r\\nGandalf had shaken his head and said nothing. Dwarves had not passed that way\\r\\nfor many years, but Gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger had grown\\r\\nand thriven in the Wild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands, and\\r\\nthe goblins had spread in secret after the battle of the Mines of Moria. Even the\\r\\ngood plans of wise wizards like Gandalf and of good friends like Elrond go\\r\\nastray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures over the Edge of the\\r\\nWild; and Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew that something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope\\r\\nthat they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains\\r\\nwith lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled. They did not. All was well,\\r\\nuntil one day they met a thunderstorm\\xe2\\x80\\x94more than a thunderstorm, a thunder-\\r\\nbattle. You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land\\r\\nand in a river-valley; especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and\\r\\nclash. More terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night,\\r\\nwhen storms come up from East and West and make war. The lightning splinters\\r\\non the peaks, and rocks shiver, and great crashes split the air and go rolling and\\r\\ntumbling into every cave and hollow; and the darkness is filled with\\r\\noverwhelming noise and sudden light.\\r\\n     Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in\\r\\na narrow place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them. There\\r\\nthey were sheltering under a hanging rock for the night, and he lay beneath a\\r\\nblanket and shook from head to toe. When he peeped out in the lightning-\\r\\nflashes, he saw that across the valley the stone-giants were out, and were hurling\\r\\nrocks at one another for a game, and catching them, and tossing them down into\\r\\nthe darkness where they smashed among the trees far below, or splintered into\\r\\nlittle bits with a bang. Then came a wind and a rain, and the wind whipped the\\r\\nrain and the hail about in every direction, so that an overhanging rock was no\\r\\nprotection at all. Soon they were getting drenched and their ponies were standing\\r\\nwith their heads down and their tails between their legs, and some of them were\\r\\nwhinnying with fright. They could hear the giants guffawing and shouting all\\r\\nover the mountainsides.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do at all!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get blown off, or drowned,\\r\\nor struck by lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high\\r\\nfor a football.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0cThe Mountain-path\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, who was\\r\\nfeeling very grumpy, and was far from happy about the giants himself.\\r\\n    The end of their argument was that they sent Fili and Kili to look for a better\\r\\nshelter. They had very sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by\\r\\nsome fifty years they usually got these sort of jobs (when everybody could see\\r\\nthat it was absolutely no use sending Bilbo). There is nothing like looking, if you\\r\\nwant to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly\\r\\nusually find something, if you look, but it is not always quite the something you\\r\\nwere after. So it proved on this occasion.\\r\\n    Soon Fili and Kili came crawling back, holding on to the rocks in the wind.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have found a dry cave,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot far round the next corner; and\\r\\nponies and all could get inside.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you thoroughly explored it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard, who knew that caves up\\r\\nin the mountains were seldom unoccupied.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said, though everybody knew they could not have been long\\r\\nabout it; they had come back too quick. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t all that big, and it does not go\\r\\nfar back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    That, of course, is the dangerous part about caves: you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how far\\r\\nthey go back, sometimes, or where a passage behind may lead to, or what is\\r\\nwaiting for you inside. But now Fili and Kili\\xe2\\x80\\x99s news seemed good enough. So\\r\\nthey all got up and prepared to move. The wind was howling and the thunder\\r\\nstill growling, and they had a business getting themselves and their ponies along.\\r\\nStill it was not very far to go, and before long they came to a big rock standing\\r\\nout into the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the\\r\\nmountain. There was just room to get the ponies through with a squeeze, when\\r\\nthey had been unpacked and unsaddled. As they passed under the arch, it was\\r\\ngood to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all about them, and to feel\\r\\nsafe from the giants and their rocks. But the wizard was taking no risks. He lit up\\r\\nhis wand\\xe2\\x80\\x94as he did that day in Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dining-room that seemed so long ago, if\\r\\nyou remember\\xe2\\x80\\x94, and by its light they explored the cave from end to end.\\r\\n    It seemed quite a fair size, but not too large and mysterious. It had a dry floor\\r\\nand some comfortable nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies; and\\r\\nthere they stood (mighty glad of the change) steaming, and champing in their\\r\\nnosebags. Oin and Gloin wanted to light a fire at the door to dry their clothes,\\r\\nbut Gandalf would not hear of it. So they spread out their wet things on the floor,\\r\\nand got dry ones out of their bundles; then they made their blankets comfortable,\\r\\ngot out their pipes and blew smoke rings, which Gandalf turned into different\\r\\n\\x0ccolours and set dancing up by the roof to amuse them. They talked and talked,\\r\\nand forgot about the storm, and discussed what each would do with his share of\\r\\nthe treasure (when they got it, which at the moment did not seem so impossible);\\r\\nand so they dropped off to sleep one by one. And that was the last time that they\\r\\nused the ponies, packages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had\\r\\nbrought with them.\\r\\n    It turned out a good thing that night that they had brought little Bilbo with\\r\\nthem, after all. For, somehow, he could not go to sleep for a long while; and\\r\\nwhen he did sleep, he had very nasty dreams. He dreamed that a crack in the\\r\\nwall at the back of the cave got bigger and bigger, and opened wider and wider,\\r\\nand he was very afraid but could not call out or do anything but lie and look.\\r\\nThen he dreamed that the floor of the cave was giving way, and he was slipping\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows where to.\\r\\n    At that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream was\\r\\ntrue. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide\\r\\npassage. He was just in time to see the last of the ponies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 tails disappearing into\\r\\nit. Of course he gave a very loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which\\r\\nis surprising for their size.\\r\\n    Out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of\\r\\ngoblins, before you could say rocks and blocks. There were six to each dwarf, at\\r\\nleast, and two even for Bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the\\r\\ncrack, before you could say tinder and flint. But not Gandalf. Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yell had\\r\\ndone that much good. It had wakened him up wide in a splintered second, and\\r\\nwhen goblins came to grab him, there was a terrific flash like lightning in the\\r\\ncave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead.\\r\\n    The crack closed with a snap, and Bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong\\r\\nside of it! Where was Gandalf? Of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea,\\r\\nand the goblins did not wait to find out. They seized Bilbo and the dwarves and\\r\\nhurried them along. It was deep, deep, dark, such as only goblins that have taken\\r\\nto living in the heart of the mountains can see through. The passages there were\\r\\ncrossed and tangled in all directions, but the goblins knew their way, as well as\\r\\nyou do to the nearest post-office; and the way went down and down, and it was\\r\\nmost horribly stuffy. The goblins were very rough, and pinched unmercifully,\\r\\nand chuckled and laughed in their horrible stony voices; and Bilbo was more\\r\\nunhappy even than when the troll had picked him up by his toes. He wished\\r\\nagain and again for his nice bright hobbit-hole. Not for the last time.\\r\\n    Now there came a glimmer of a red light before them. The goblins began to\\r\\n\\x0csing, or croak, keeping time with the flap of their flat feet on the stone, and\\r\\nshaking their prisoners as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Clap! Snap! the black crack!\\r\\n       Grip, grab! Pinch, nab!\\r\\n       And down down to Goblin-town\\r\\n         You go, my lad!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Clash, crash! Crush, smash!\\r\\n       Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs!\\r\\n       Pound, pound, far underground!\\r\\n         Ho, ho! my lad!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Swish, smack! Whip crack!\\r\\n       Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat!\\r\\n       Work, work! Nor dare to shirk,\\r\\n       While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh,\\r\\n       Round and round far underground\\r\\n         Below, my lad!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    It sounded truly terrifying. The walls echoed to the clap, snap! and the crush,\\r\\nsmash! and to the ugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! The general meaning of\\r\\nthe song was only too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and whipped\\r\\nthem with a swish, smack!, and set them running as fast as they could in front of\\r\\nthem; and more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and bleating\\r\\nlike anything, when they stumbled into a big cavern.\\r\\n    It was lit by a great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls, and\\r\\nit was full of goblins. They all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands,\\r\\nwhen the dwarves (with poor little Bilbo at the back and nearest to the whips)\\r\\ncame running in, while the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips\\r\\nbehind. The ponies were already there huddled in a corner; and there were all the\\r\\nbaggages and packages lying broken open, and being rummaged by goblins, and\\r\\nsmelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and quarrelled over by goblins.\\r\\n    I am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies,\\r\\n\\x0cincluding a jolly sturdy little white fellow that Elrond had lent to Gandalf, since\\r\\nhis horse was not suitable for the mountain-paths. For goblins eat horses and\\r\\nponies and donkeys (and other much more dreadful things), and they are always\\r\\nhungry. Just now however the prisoners were thinking only of themselves. The\\r\\ngoblins chained their hands behind their backs and linked them all together in a\\r\\nline, and dragged them to the far end of the cavern with little Bilbo tugging at\\r\\nthe end of the row.\\r\\n     There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a\\r\\nhuge head, and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the\\r\\nbent swords that they use. Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. They\\r\\nmake no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. They can tunnel and\\r\\nmine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble,\\r\\nthough they are usually untidy and dirty. Hammers, axes, swords, daggers,\\r\\npickaxes, tongs, and also instruments of torture, they make very well, or get\\r\\nother people to make to their design, prisoners and slaves that have to work till\\r\\nthey die for want of air and light. It is not unlikely that they invented some of the\\r\\nmachines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for\\r\\nkilling large numbers of people at once, for wheels and engines and explosions\\r\\nalways delighted them, and also not working with their own hands more than\\r\\nthey could help; but in those days and those wild parts they had not advanced (as\\r\\nit is called) so far. They did not hate dwarves especially, no more than they hated\\r\\neverybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in some\\r\\nparts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. But they had a special\\r\\ngrudge against Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s people, because of the war which you have heard\\r\\nmentioned, but which does not come into this tale; and anyway goblins don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\ncare who they catch, as long as it is done smart and secret, and the prisoners are\\r\\nnot able to defend themselves.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are these miserable persons?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Great Goblin.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDwarves, and this!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the drivers, pulling at Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chain so that\\r\\nhe fell forward onto his knees. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe found them sheltering in our Front Porch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Great Goblin turning to Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUp to\\r\\nno good, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll warrant! Spying on the private business of my people, I guess!\\r\\nThieves, I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be surprised to learn! Murderers and friends of Elves, not\\r\\nunlikely! Come! What have you got to say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThorin the dwarf at your service!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was merely a polite\\r\\nnothing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf the things which you suspect and imagine we had no idea at all. We\\r\\nsheltered from a storm in what seemed a convenient cave and unused; nothing\\r\\n\\x0cwas further from our thoughts than inconveniencing goblins in any way\\r\\nwhatever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That was true enough!\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUm!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Great Goblin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo you say! Might I ask what you were doing\\r\\nup in the mountains at all, and where you were coming from, and where you\\r\\nwere going to? In fact I should like to know all about you. Not that it will do you\\r\\nmuch good, Thorin Oakenshield, I know too much about your folk already; but\\r\\nlet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have the truth, or I will prepare something particularly uncomfortable for\\r\\nyou!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were on a journey to visit our relatives, our nephews and nieces, and\\r\\nfirst, second, and third cousins, and the other descendants of our grandfathers,\\r\\nwho live on the East side of these truly hospitable mountains,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, not\\r\\nquite knowing what to say all at once in a moment, when obviously the exact\\r\\ntruth would not do at all.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is a liar, O truly tremendous one!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the drivers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeveral of\\r\\nour people were struck by lightning in the cave, when we invited these creatures\\r\\nto come below; and they are as dead as stones. Also he has not explained this!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nHe held out the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword which came from the\\r\\nTrolls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lair.\\r\\n    The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and\\r\\nall his soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. They\\r\\nknew the sword at once. It had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the\\r\\nfair elves of Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls.\\r\\nThey had called it Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter.\\r\\nThey hated it and hated worse any one that carried it.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMurderers and elf-friends!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Great Goblin shouted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSlash them! Beat\\r\\nthem! Bite them! Gnash them! Take them away to dark holes full of snakes, and\\r\\nnever let them see the light again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He was in such a rage that he jumped off his\\r\\nseat and himself rushed at Thorin with his mouth open.\\r\\n    Just at that moment all the lights in the cavern went out, and the great fire\\r\\nwent off poof! into a tower of blue glowing smoke, right up to the roof, that\\r\\nscattered piercing white sparks all among the goblins.\\r\\n    The yells and yammering, croaking, jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls\\r\\nand curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed were beyond description.\\r\\nSeveral hundred wild cats and wolves being roasted slowly alive together would\\r\\nnot have compared with it. The sparks were burning holes in the goblins, and the\\r\\nsmoke that now fell from the roof made the air too thick for even their eyes to\\r\\nsee through. Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the\\r\\n\\x0cfloor, biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad.\\r\\n    Suddenly a sword flashed in its own light. Bilbo saw it go right through the\\r\\nGreat Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage. He fell dead,\\r\\nand the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into the darkness.\\r\\n    The sword went back into its sheath. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFollow me quick!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a voice fierce\\r\\nand quiet; and before Bilbo understood what had happened he was trotting along\\r\\nagain, as fast as he could trot, at the end of the line, down more dark passages\\r\\nwith the yells of the goblin-hall growing fainter behind him. A pale light was\\r\\nleading them on.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuicker, quicker!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe torches will soon be relit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHalf a minute!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dori, who was at the back next to Bilbo, and a decent\\r\\nfellow. He made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as best he could with his\\r\\ntied hands, and then off they all went at a run, with a clink-clink of chains, and\\r\\nmany a stumble, since they had no hands to steady themselves with. Not for a\\r\\nlong while did they stop, and by that time they must have been right down in the\\r\\nvery mountain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart.\\r\\n    Then Gandalf lit up his wand. Of course it was Gandalf; but just then they\\r\\nwere too busy to ask how he got there. He took out his sword again, and again it\\r\\nflashed in the dark by itself. It burned with a rage that made it gleam if goblins\\r\\nwere about; now it was bright as blue flame for delight in the killing of the great\\r\\nlord of the cave. It made no trouble whatever of cutting through the goblin-\\r\\nchains and setting all the prisoners free as quickly as possible. This sword\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nname was Glamdring the Foe-hammer, if you remember. The goblins just called\\r\\nit Beater, and hated it worse than Biter if possible. Orcrist, too, had been saved;\\r\\nfor Gandalf had brought it along as well, snatching it from one of the terrified\\r\\nguards. Gandalf thought of most things; and though he could not do everything,\\r\\nhe could do a great deal for friends in a tight corner.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre we all here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, handing his sword back to Thorin with a bow.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me see: one\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,\\r\\nten, eleven; where are Fili and Kili? Here they are! twelve, thirteen\\xe2\\x80\\x94and here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nMr. Baggins: fourteen! Well, well! it might be worse, and then again it might be\\r\\na good deal better. No ponies, and no food, and no knowing quite where we are,\\r\\nand hordes of angry goblins just behind! On we go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    On they went. Gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and\\r\\nhorrible cries far behind in the passages they had come through. That sent them\\r\\non faster than ever, and as poor Bilbo could not possibly go half as fast\\xe2\\x80\\x94for\\r\\ndwarves can roll along at a tremendous pace, I can tell you, when they have to\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\\x0cthey took it in turn to carry him on their backs.\\r\\n    Still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better\\r\\n(they had made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what\\r\\nthey could the dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and closer. Soon\\r\\nthey could hear even the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet which seemed\\r\\nonly just round the last corner. The blink of red torches could be seen behind\\r\\nthem in the tunnel they were following; and they were getting deadly tired.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, O why did I ever leave my hobbit-hole!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said poor Mr. Baggins\\r\\nbumping up and down on Bombur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, O why did I ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid poor Bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with the sweat dripping\\r\\ndown his nose in his heat and terror.\\r\\n    At this point Gandalf fell behind, and Thorin with him. They turned a sharp\\r\\ncorner. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout turn!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDraw your sword Thorin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    There was nothing else to be done; and the goblins did not like it. They came\\r\\nscurrying round the corner in full cry, and found Goblin-cleaver, and Foe-\\r\\nhammer shining cold and bright right in their astonished eyes. The ones in front\\r\\ndropped their torches and gave one yell before they were killed. The ones behind\\r\\nyelled still more, and leaped back knocking over those that were running after\\r\\nthem. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBiter and Beater!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they shrieked; and soon they were all in confusion,\\r\\nand most of them were hustling back the way they had come.\\r\\n    It was quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that corner. By that\\r\\ntime the dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels\\r\\nof the goblins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 realm. When the goblins discovered that, they put out their\\r\\ntorches and they slipped on soft shoes, and they chose out their very quickest\\r\\nrunners with the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran forward, as swift as weasels in\\r\\nthe dark, and with hardly any more noise than bats.\\r\\n    That is why neither Bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even Gandalf heard them\\r\\ncoming. Nor did they see them. But they were seen by the goblins that ran\\r\\nsilently up behind, for Gandalf was letting his wand give out a faint light to help\\r\\nthe dwarves as they went along.\\r\\n    Quite suddenly Dori, now at the back again carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from\\r\\nbehind in the dark. He shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled off his shoulders\\r\\ninto the blackness, bumped his head on hard rock, and remembered nothing\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter V\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRIDDLES IN THE DARK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as\\r\\nwith them shut. No one was anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He\\r\\ncould hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the stone of the\\r\\nfloor.\\r\\n    Very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall\\r\\nof the tunnel; but neither up nor down it could he find anything: nothing at all,\\r\\nno sign of goblins, no sign of dwarves. His head was swimming, and he was far\\r\\nfrom certain even of the direction they had been going in when he had his fall.\\r\\nHe guessed as well as he could, and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly\\r\\nhis hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the\\r\\ntunnel. It was a turning point in his career, but he did not know it. He put the ring\\r\\nin his pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did not seem of any particular\\r\\nuse at the moment. He did not go much further, but sat down on the cold floor\\r\\nand gave himself up to complete miserableness, for a long while. He thought of\\r\\nhimself frying bacon and eggs in his own kitchen at home\\xe2\\x80\\x94for he could feel\\r\\ninside that it was high time for some meal or other; but that only made him\\r\\nmiserabler.\\r\\n    He could not think what to do; nor could he think what had happened; or why\\r\\nhe had been left behind; or why, if he had been left behind, the goblins had not\\r\\ncaught him; or even why his head was so sore. The truth was he had been lying\\r\\nquiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a long while.\\r\\n    After some time he felt for his pipe. It was not broken, and that was\\r\\nsomething. Then he felt for his pouch, and there was some tobacco in it, and that\\r\\nwas something more. Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at all,\\r\\nand that shattered his hopes completely. Just as well for him, as he agreed when\\r\\n\\x0che came to his senses. Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the\\r\\nsmell of tobacco would have brought on him out of dark holes in that horrible\\r\\nplace. Still at the moment he felt very crushed. But in slapping all his pockets\\r\\nand feeling all round himself for matches his hand came on the hilt of his little\\r\\nsword\\xe2\\x80\\x94the little dagger that he got from the trolls, and that he had quite\\r\\nforgotten; nor fortunately had the goblins noticed it, as he wore it inside his\\r\\nbreeches.\\r\\n     Now he drew it out. It shone pale and dim before his eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo it is an elvish\\r\\nblade, too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     But somehow he was comforted. It was rather splendid to be wearing a blade\\r\\nmade in Gondolin for the goblin-wars of which so many songs had sung; and\\r\\nalso he had noticed that such weapons made a great impression on goblins that\\r\\ncame upon them suddenly.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo back?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo good at all! Go sideways? Impossible! Go\\r\\nforward? Only thing to do! On we go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So up he got, and trotted along with his\\r\\nlittle sword held in front of him and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all\\r\\nof a patter and a pitter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight place. But you must remember\\r\\nit was not quite so tight for him as it would have been for me or for you. Hobbits\\r\\nare not quite like ordinary people; and after all if their holes are nice cheery\\r\\nplaces and properly aired, quite different from the tunnels of the goblins, still\\r\\nthey are more used to tunnelling than we are, and they do not easily lose their\\r\\nsense of direction underground\\xe2\\x80\\x94not when their heads have recovered from\\r\\nbeing bumped. Also they can move very quietly, and hide easily, and recover\\r\\nwonderfully from falls and bruises, and they have a fund of wisdom and wise\\r\\nsayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago.\\r\\n    I should not have liked to have been in Mr. Baggins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 place, all the same. The\\r\\ntunnel seemed to have no end. All he knew was that it was still going down\\r\\npretty steadily and keeping in the same direction in spite of a twist and a turn or\\r\\ntwo. There were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as he knew\\r\\nby the glimmer of his sword, or could feel with his hand on the wall. Of these he\\r\\ntook no notice, except to hurry past for fear of goblins or half-imagined dark\\r\\nthings coming out of them. On and on he went, and down and down; and still he\\r\\nheard no sound of anything except the occasional whirr of a bat by his ears,\\r\\nwhich startled him at first, till it became too frequent to bother about. I do not\\r\\n\\x0cknow how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring to stop, on, on,\\r\\nuntil he was tireder than tired. It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it\\r\\nto the days beyond.\\r\\n     Suddenly without any warning he trotted splash into water! Ugh! it was icy\\r\\ncold. That pulled him up sharp and short. He did not know whether it was just a\\r\\npool in the path, or the edge of an underground stream that crossed the passage,\\r\\nor the brink of a deep dark subterranean lake. The sword was hardly shining at\\r\\nall. He stopped, and he could hear, when he listened hard, drops drip-drip-\\r\\ndripping from an unseen roof into the water below; but there seemed no other\\r\\nsort of sound.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo it is a pool or a lake, and not an underground river,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought. Still he\\r\\ndid not dare to wade out into the darkness. He could not swim; and he thought,\\r\\ntoo, of nasty slimy things, with big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in the water.\\r\\nThere are strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains:\\r\\nfish whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and\\r\\nnever swam out again, while their eyes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from\\r\\ntrying to see in the blackness; also there are other things more slimy than fish.\\r\\nEven in the tunnels and caves the goblins have made for themselves there are\\r\\nother things living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in from outside to lie\\r\\nup in the dark. Some of these caves, too, go back in their beginnings to ages\\r\\nbefore the goblins, who only widened them and joined them up with passages,\\r\\nand the original owners are still there in odd corners, slinking and nosing about.\\r\\n     Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where he came from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum\\xe2\\x80\\x94as\\r\\ndark as darkness, except for two big round pale eyes in his thin face. He had a\\r\\nlittle boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and\\r\\ndeep and deadly cold. He paddled it with large feet dangling over the side, but\\r\\nnever a ripple did he make. Not he. He was looking out of his pale lamp-like\\r\\neyes for blind fish, which he grabbed with his long fingers as quick as thinking.\\r\\nHe liked meat too. Goblin he thought good, when he could get it; but he took\\r\\ncare they never found him out. He just throttled them from behind, if they ever\\r\\ncame down alone anywhere near the edge of the water, while he was prowling\\r\\nabout. They very seldom did, for they had a feeling that something unpleasant\\r\\nwas lurking down there, down at the very roots of the mountain. They had come\\r\\non the lake, when they were tunnelling down long ago, and they found they\\r\\ncould go no further; so there their road ended in that direction, and there was no\\r\\nreason to go that way\\xe2\\x80\\x94unless the Great Goblin sent them. Sometimes he took a\\r\\n\\x0cfancy for fish from the lake, and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back.\\r\\n    Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of the lake. He\\r\\nwas watching Bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes like telescopes.\\r\\nBilbo could not see him, but he was wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could\\r\\nsee that he was no goblin at all.\\r\\n    Gollum got into his boat and shot off from the island, while Bilbo was sitting\\r\\non the brink altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way and his wits.\\r\\nSuddenly up came Gollum and whispered and hissed:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBless us and splash us, my precioussss! I guess it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a choice feast; at least a\\r\\ntasty morsel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d make us, gollum!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And when he said gollum he made a horrible\\r\\nswallowing noise in his throat. That is how he got his name, though he always\\r\\ncalled himself \\xe2\\x80\\x98my precious\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\\r\\n    The hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears, and\\r\\nhe suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat iss he, my preciouss?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whispered Gollum (who always spoke to\\r\\nhimself through never having anyone else to speak to). This is what he had come\\r\\nto find out, for he was not really very hungry at the moment, only curious;\\r\\notherwise he would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the dwarves and I have lost the wizard,\\r\\nand I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where I am; and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to know, if only I can get away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he got in his handses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum, looking at the sword, which he\\r\\ndid not quite like.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSssss\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum, and became quite polite. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPraps ye sits here and chats\\r\\nwith it a bitsy, my preciousss. It likes riddles, praps it does, does it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He was\\r\\nanxious to appear friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until he found out\\r\\nmore about the sword and the hobbit, whether he was quite alone really, whether\\r\\nhe was good to eat, and whether Gollum was really hungry. Riddles were all he\\r\\ncould think of. Asking them, and sometimes guessing them, had been the only\\r\\ngame he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in the\\r\\nlong, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and\\r\\ncrept down, down, into the dark under the mountains.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, who was anxious to agree, until he found out more\\r\\nabout the creature, whether he was quite alone, whether he was fierce or hungry,\\r\\nand whether he was a friend of the goblins.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou ask first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, because he had not had time to think of a riddle.\\r\\n\\x0c   So Gollum hissed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       What has roots as nobody sees,\\r\\n       Is taller than trees,\\r\\n          Up, up it goes,\\r\\n          And yet never grows?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEasy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMountain, I suppose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes it guess easy? It must have a competition with us, my preciouss! If\\r\\nprecious asks, and it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer, we eats it, my preciousss. If it asks us, and\\r\\nwe doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer, then we does what it wants, eh? We shows it the way out,\\r\\nyes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, not daring to disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to\\r\\nthink of riddles that could save him from being eaten.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Thirty white horses on a red hill,\\r\\n       First they champ,\\r\\n         Then they stamp,\\r\\n         Then they stand still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    That was all he could think of to ask\\xe2\\x80\\x94the idea of eating was rather on his\\r\\nmind. It was rather an old one, too, and Gollum knew the answer as well as you\\r\\ndo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChestnuts, chestnuts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he hissed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTeeth! teeth! my preciousss; but we has\\r\\nonly six!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then he asked his second:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Voiceless it cries,\\r\\n       Wingless flutters,\\r\\n       Toothless bites,\\r\\n       Mouthless mutters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHalf a moment!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bilbo, who was still thinking uncomfortably about\\r\\neating. Fortunately he had once heard something rather like this before, and\\r\\n\\x0cgetting his wits back he thought of the answer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWind, wind of course,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\nand he was so pleased that he made up one on the spot. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll puzzle the nasty\\r\\nlittle underground creature,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       An eye in a blue face\\r\\n       Saw an eye in a green face.\\r\\n       \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat eye is like to this eye\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n       Said the first eye,\\r\\n       \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut in low place\\r\\n       Not in high place.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSs, ss, ss,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum. He had been underground a long long time, and was\\r\\nforgetting this sort of thing. But just as Bilbo was beginning to hope that the\\r\\nwretch would not be able to answer, Gollum brought up memories of ages and\\r\\nages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by\\r\\na river, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSss, sss, my preciouss,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSun on the daisies it means, it does.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    But these ordinary above ground everyday sort of riddles were tiring for him.\\r\\nAlso they reminded him of days when he had been less lonely and sneaky and\\r\\nnasty, and that put him out of temper. What is more they made him hungry; so\\r\\nthis time he tried something a bit more difficult and more unpleasant:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,\\r\\n       Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt.\\r\\n       It lies behind stars and under hills,\\r\\n           And empty holes it fills.\\r\\n       It comes first and follows after,\\r\\n           Ends life, kills laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   Unfortunately for Gollum Bilbo had heard that sort of thing before; and the\\r\\nanswer was all round him any way. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDark!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said without even scratching his\\r\\nhead or putting on his thinking cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       A box without hinges, key, or lid,\\r\\n       Yet golden treasure inside is hid,\\r\\n\\x0che asked to gain time, until he could think of a really hard one. This he thought a\\r\\ndreadfully easy chestnut, though he had not asked it in the usual words. But it\\r\\nproved a nasty poser for Gollum. He hissed to himself, and still he did not\\r\\nanswer; he whispered and spluttered.\\r\\n   After some while Bilbo became impatient. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, what is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\r\\nanswer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a kettle boiling over, as you seem to think from the noise you are\\r\\nmaking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGive us a chance; let it give us a chance, my preciouss\\xe2\\x80\\x94ss\\xe2\\x80\\x94ss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo after giving him a long chance, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat about your guess?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   But suddenly Gollum remembered thieving from nests long ago, and sitting\\r\\nunder the river bank teaching his grandmother, teaching his grandmother to suck\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEggses!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he hissed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEggses it is!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then he asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Alive without breath,\\r\\n       As cold as death;\\r\\n       Never thirsty, ever drinking,\\r\\n       All in mail never clinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    He also in his turn thought this was a dreadfully easy one, because he was\\r\\nalways thinking of the answer. But he could not remember anything better at the\\r\\nmoment, he was so flustered by the egg-question. All the same it was a poser for\\r\\npoor Bilbo, who never had anything to do with the water if he could help it. I\\r\\nimagine you know the answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking,\\r\\nsince you are sitting comfortably at home and have not the danger of being eaten\\r\\nto disturb your thinking. Bilbo sat and cleared his throat once or twice, but no\\r\\nanswer came.\\r\\n    After a while Gollum began to hiss with pleasure to himself: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it nice, my\\r\\npreciousss? Is it juicy? Is it scrumptiously crunchable?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He began to peer at\\r\\nBilbo out of the darkness.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHalf a moment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the hobbit shivering. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI gave you a good long chance\\r\\njust now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must make haste, haste!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum, beginning to climb out of his boat\\r\\non to the shore to get at Bilbo. But when he put his long webby foot in the water,\\r\\na fish jumped out in a fright and fell on Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s toes.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUgh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is cold and clammy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so he guessed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFish! fish!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is fish!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    Gollum was dreadfully disappointed; but Bilbo asked another riddle as quick\\r\\nas ever he could, so that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think.\\r\\n    No-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some.\\r\\n    It was not really the right time for this riddle, but Bilbo was in a hurry.\\r\\nGollum might have had some trouble guessing it, if he had asked it at another\\r\\ntime. As it was, talking of fish, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno-legs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was not so very difficult, and after that\\r\\nthe rest was easy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFish on a little table, man at table sitting on a stool, the cat\\r\\nhas the bones\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that of course is the answer, and Gollum soon gave it. Then he\\r\\nthought the time had come to ask something hard and horrible. This is what he\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       This thing all things devours:\\r\\n       Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;\\r\\n       Gnaws iron, bites steel;\\r\\n       Grinds hard stones to meal;\\r\\n       Slays king, ruins town,\\r\\n       And beats high mountain down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   Poor Bilbo sat in the dark thinking of all the horrible names of all the giants\\r\\nand ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all\\r\\nthese things. He had a feeling that the answer was quite different and that he\\r\\nought to know it, but he could not think of it. He began to get frightened, and\\r\\nthat is bad for thinking. Gollum began to get out of his boat. He flapped into the\\r\\nwater and paddled to the bank; Bilbo could see his eyes coming towards him.\\r\\nHis tongue seemed to stick in his mouth; he wanted to shout out: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGive me more\\r\\ntime! Give me time!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But all that came out with a sudden squeal was:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTime! Time!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n    Bilbo was saved by pure luck. For that of course was the answer.\\r\\n    Gollum was disappointed once more; and now he was getting angry, and also\\r\\ntired of the game. It had made him very hungry indeed. This time he did not go\\r\\nback to the boat. He sat down in the dark by Bilbo. That made the hobbit most\\r\\ndreadfully uncomfortable and scattered his wits.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to ask uss a quesstion, my preciouss, yes, yess, yesss. Jusst one more\\r\\nquestion to guess, yes, yess,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum.\\r\\n\\x0c     But Bilbo simply could not think of any question with that nasty wet cold\\r\\nthing sitting next to him, and pawing and poking him. He scratched himself, he\\r\\npinched himself; still he could not think of anything.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAsk us! ask us!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum.\\r\\n     Bilbo pinched himself and slapped himself; he gripped on his little sword; he\\r\\neven felt in his pocket with his other hand. There he found the ring he had\\r\\npicked up in the passage and forgotten about.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat have I got in my pocket?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said aloud. He was talking to himself,\\r\\nbut Gollum thought it was a riddle, and he was frightfully upset.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot fair! not fair!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he hissed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fair, my precious, is it, to ask us what\\r\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got in its nassty little pocketses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     Bilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better to ask stuck to his\\r\\nquestion, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat have I got in my pocket?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said louder.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS-s-s-s-s,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hissed Gollum. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must give us three guesseses, my preciouss,\\r\\nthree guesseses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well! Guess away!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHandses!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, who had luckily just taken his hand out again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGuess\\r\\nagain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cS-s-s-s-s,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum more upset than ever. He thought of all the things he\\r\\nkept in his own pockets: fish-bones, goblins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 teeth, wet shells, a bit of bat-wing,\\r\\na sharp stone to sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. He tried to think\\r\\nwhat other people kept in their pockets.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnife!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWrong!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, who had lost his some time ago. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLast guess!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     Now Gollum was in a much worse state than when Bilbo had asked him the\\r\\negg-question. He hissed and spluttered and rocked himself backwards and\\r\\nforwards, and slapped his feet on the floor, and wriggled and squirmed; but still\\r\\nhe did not dare to waste his last guess.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am waiting!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He tried to sound bold and cheerful,\\r\\nbut he did not feel at all sure how the game was going to end, whether Gollum\\r\\nguessed right or not.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTime\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cString, or nothing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shrieked Gollum, which was not quite fair\\xe2\\x80\\x94working in\\r\\ntwo guesses at once.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth wrong,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bilbo very much relieved; and he jumped at once to his\\r\\nfeet, put his back to the nearest wall, and held out his little sword. He knew, of\\r\\n\\x0ccourse, that the riddle-game was sacred and of immense antiquity, and even\\r\\nwicked creatures were afraid to cheat when they played at it. But he felt he could\\r\\nnot trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse would do\\r\\nfor him to slide out of it. And after all that last question had not been a genuine\\r\\nriddle according to the ancient laws.\\r\\n    But at any rate Gollum did not at once attack him. He could see the sword in\\r\\nBilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand. He sat still, shivering and whispering. At last Bilbo could wait no\\r\\nlonger.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about your promise? I want to go. You must show me\\r\\nthe way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid we say so, precious? Show the nassty little Baggins the way out, yes,\\r\\nyes. But what has it got in its pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, but not\\r\\nnothing. Oh no! gollum!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever you mind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA promise is a promise.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCross it is, impatient, precious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hissed Gollum. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it must wait, yes it\\r\\nmust. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go up the tunnels so hasty. We must go and get some things first,\\r\\nyes, things to help us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, hurry up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, relieved to think of Gollum going away. He\\r\\nthought he was just making an excuse and did not mean to come back. What was\\r\\nGollum talking about? What useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake?\\r\\nBut he was wrong. Gollum did mean to come back. He was angry now and\\r\\nhungry. And he was a miserable wicked creature, and already he had a plan.\\r\\n    Not far away was his island, of which Bilbo knew nothing, and there in his\\r\\nhiding-place he kept a few wretched oddments, and one very beautiful thing,\\r\\nvery beautiful, very wonderful. He had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy birthday-present!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered to himself, as he had often done in the\\r\\nendless dark days. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we wants now, yes; we wants it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    He wanted it because it was a ring of power, and if you slipped that ring on\\r\\nyour finger, you were invisible; only in the full sunlight could you be seen, and\\r\\nthen only by your shadow, and that would be shaky and faint.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy birthday-present! It came to me on my birthday, my precious.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So he\\r\\nhad always said to himself. But who knows how Gollum came by that present,\\r\\nages ago in the old days when such rings were still at large in the world? Perhaps\\r\\neven the Master who ruled them could not have said. Gollum used to wear it at\\r\\nfirst, till it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin, till it galled\\r\\nhim; and now usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was always\\r\\ngoing back to look at it. And still sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear\\r\\n\\x0cto be parted from it any longer, or when he was very, very, hungry, and tired of\\r\\nfish. Then he would creep along dark passages looking for stray goblins. He\\r\\nmight even venture into places where the torches were lit and made his eyes\\r\\nblink and smart; for he would be safe. Oh yes, quite safe. No one would see him,\\r\\nno one would notice him, till he had his fingers on their throat. Only a few hours\\r\\nago he had worn it, and caught a small goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still\\r\\nhad a bone or two left to gnaw, but he wanted something softer.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite safe, yes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered to himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see us, will it, my\\r\\nprecious? No. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see us, and its nassty little sword will be useless, yes\\r\\nquite.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    That is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from\\r\\nBilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side, and flapped back to his boat, and went off into the dark. Bilbo\\r\\nthought he had heard the last of him. Still he waited a while; for he had no idea\\r\\nhow to find his way out alone.\\r\\n    Suddenly he heard a screech. It sent a shiver down his back. Gollum was\\r\\ncursing and wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the sound of it. He\\r\\nwas on his island, scrabbling here and there, searching and seeking in vain.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere iss it? Where iss it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bilbo heard him crying. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLosst it is, my\\r\\nprecious, lost, lost! Curse us and crush us, my precious is lost!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the matter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bilbo called. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat have you lost?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt mustn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shrieked Gollum. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot its business, no, gollum! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s losst,\\r\\ngollum, gollum, gollum.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, so am I,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I want to get unlost. And I won the game,\\r\\nand you promised. So come along! Come and let me out, and then go on with\\r\\nyour looking!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Utterly miserable as Gollum sounded, Bilbo could not find much\\r\\npity in his heart, and he had a feeling that anything Gollum wanted so much\\r\\ncould hardly be something good. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome along!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, not yet, precious!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gollum answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must search for it, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lost,\\r\\ngollum.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you never guessed my last question, and you promised,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever guessed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum. Then suddenly out of the gloom came a sharp\\r\\nhiss. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat has it got in its pocketses? Tell us that. It must tell first.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    As far as Bilbo knew, there was no particular reason why he should not tell.\\r\\nGollum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind had jumped to a guess quicker than his; naturally, for Gollum had\\r\\nbrooded for ages on this one thing, and he was always afraid of its being stolen.\\r\\nBut Bilbo was annoyed at the delay. After all, he had won the game, pretty fairly,\\r\\nat a horrible risk. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnswers were to be guessed not given,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a fair question,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gollum. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot a riddle, precious, no.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh well, if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a matter of ordinary questions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bilbo replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen I asked\\r\\none first. What have you lost? Tell me that!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat has it got in its pocketses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The sound came hissing louder and\\r\\nsharper, and as he looked towards it, to his alarm Bilbo now saw two small\\r\\npoints of light peering at him. As suspicion grew in Gollum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind, the light of\\r\\nhis eyes burned with a pale flame.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat have you lost?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bilbo persisted.\\r\\n    But now the light in Gollum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes had become a green fire, and it was\\r\\ncoming swiftly nearer. Gollum was in his boat again, paddling wildly back to the\\r\\ndark shore; and such a rage of loss and suspicion was in his heart that no sword\\r\\nhad any more terror for him.\\r\\n    Bilbo could not guess what had maddened the wretched creature, but he saw\\r\\nthat all was up, and that Gollum meant to murder him at any rate. Just in time he\\r\\nturned and ran blindly back up the dark passage down which he had come,\\r\\nkeeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left hand.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat has it got in its pocketses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he heard the hiss loud behind him, and the\\r\\nsplash as Gollum leapt from his boat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat have I, I wonder?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to\\r\\nhimself, as he panted and stumbled along. He put his left hand in his pocket. The\\r\\nring felt very cold as it quietly slipped on to his groping forefinger.\\r\\n    The hiss was close behind him. He turned now and saw Gollum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes like\\r\\nsmall green lamps coming up the slope. Terrified he tried to run faster, but\\r\\nsuddenly he struck his toes on a snag in the floor, and fell flat with his little\\r\\nsword under him.\\r\\n    In a moment Gollum was on him. But before Bilbo could do anything,\\r\\nrecover his breath, pick himself up, or wave his sword, Gollum passed by, taking\\r\\nno notice of him, cursing and whispering as he ran.\\r\\n    What could it mean? Gollum could see in the dark. Bilbo could see the light\\r\\nof his eyes palely shining even from behind. Painfully he got up, and sheathed\\r\\nhis sword, which was now glowing faintly again, then very cautiously he\\r\\nfollowed. There seemed nothing else to do. It was no good crawling back down\\r\\nto Gollum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might lead him to some\\r\\nway of escape without meaning to.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCurse it! curse it! curse it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hissed Gollum. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCurse the Baggins! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone!\\r\\nWhat has it got in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my precious. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfound it, yes he must have. My birthday-present.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Bilbo pricked up his ears. He was at last beginning to guess himself. He\\r\\n\\x0churried a little, getting as close as he dared behind Gollum, who was still going\\r\\nquickly, not looking back, but turning his head from side to side, as Bilbo could\\r\\nsee from the faint glimmer on the walls.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy birthday-present! Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nit. When we came this way last, when we twisted that nassty young squeaker.\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it. Curse it! It slipped from us, after all these ages and ages! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone,\\r\\ngollum.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling\\r\\nsound horrible to listen to. Bilbo halted and flattened himself against the tunnel-\\r\\nwall. After a while Gollum stopped weeping and began to talk. He seemed to be\\r\\nhaving an argument with himself.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no good going back there to search, no. We doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remember all the\\r\\nplaces we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve visited. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no use. The Baggins has got it in its pocketses; the\\r\\nnassty noser has found it, we says.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe guesses, precious, only guesses. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know till we find the nassty\\r\\ncreature and squeezes it. But it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what the present can do, does it?\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just keep it in its pocketses. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, and it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go far. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lost\\r\\nitself, the nassty nosey thing. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the way out. It said so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt said so, yes; but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tricksy. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say what it means. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say\\r\\nwhat it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got in its pocketses. It knows. It knows a way in, it must know a way\\r\\nout, yes. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s off to the back-door. To the back-door, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe goblinses will catch it then. It can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get out that way, precious.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSsss, sss, gollum! Goblinses! Yes, but if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got the present, our precious\\r\\npresent, then goblinses will get it, gollum! They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find it, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find out what it\\r\\ndoes. We shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ever be safe again, never, gollum! One of the goblinses will put\\r\\nit on, and then no one will see him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be there but not seen. Not even our\\r\\nclever eyeses will notice him; and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come creepsy and tricksy and catch us,\\r\\ngollum, gollum!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stop talking, precious, and make haste. If the Baggins has gone\\r\\nthat way, we must go quick and see. Go! Not far now. Make haste!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    With a spring Gollum got up and started shambling off at a great pace. Bilbo\\r\\nhurried after him, still cautiously, though his chief fear now was of tripping on\\r\\nanother snag and falling with a noise. His head was in a whirl of hope and\\r\\nwonder. It seemed that the ring he had was a magic ring: it made you invisible!\\r\\nHe had heard of such things, of course, in old old tales; but it was hard to believe\\r\\nthat he really had found one, by accident. Still there it was: Gollum with his\\r\\nbright eyes had passed him by, only a yard to one side.\\r\\n\\x0c    On they went, Gollum flip-flapping ahead, hissing and cursing; Bilbo behind\\r\\ngoing as softly as a hobbit can. Soon they came to places where, as Bilbo had\\r\\nnoticed on the way down, side-passages opened, this way and that. Gollum\\r\\nbegan at once to count them.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne left, yes. One right, yes. Two right, yes, yes. Two left, yes, yes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And so\\r\\non and on.\\r\\n    As the count grew he slowed down, and he began to get shaky and weepy; for\\r\\nhe was leaving the water further and further behind, and he was getting afraid.\\r\\nGoblins might be about, and he had lost his ring. At last he stopped by a low\\r\\nopening, on their left as they went up.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeven right, yes. Six left, yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is it. This is the way to\\r\\nthe back-door, yes. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the passage!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    He peered in, and shrank back. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut we dursn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go in, precious, no we\\r\\ndursn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Goblinses down there. Lots of goblinses. We smells them. Ssss!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat shall we do? Curse them and crush them! We must wait here,\\r\\nprecious, wait a bit and see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    So they came to a dead stop. Gollum had brought Bilbo to the way out after\\r\\nall, but Bilbo could not get in! There was Gollum sitting humped up right in the\\r\\nopening, and his eyes gleamed cold in his head, as he swayed it from side to side\\r\\nbetween his knees.\\r\\n    Bilbo crept away from the wall more quietly than a mouse; but Gollum\\r\\nstiffened at once, and sniffed, and his eyes went green. He hissed softly but\\r\\nmenacingly. He could not see the hobbit, but now he was on the alert, and he had\\r\\nother senses that the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell. He seemed to\\r\\nbe crouched right down with his flat hands splayed on the floor, and his head\\r\\nthrust out, nose almost to the stone. Though he was only a black shadow in the\\r\\ngleam of his own eyes, Bilbo could see or feel that he was tense as a bowstring,\\r\\ngathered for a spring.\\r\\n    Bilbo almost stopped breathing, and went stiff himself. He was desperate. He\\r\\nmust get away, out of this horrible darkness, while he had any strength left. He\\r\\nmust fight. He must stab the foul thing, put its eyes out, kill it. It meant to kill\\r\\nhim. No, not a fair fight. He was invisible now. Gollum had no sword. Gollum\\r\\nhad not actually threatened to kill him, or tried to yet. And he was miserable,\\r\\nalone, lost. A sudden understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled up in\\r\\nBilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart: a glimpse of endless unmarked days without light or hope of\\r\\nbetterment, hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and whispering. All these thoughts\\r\\npassed in a flash of a second. He trembled. And then quite suddenly in another\\r\\n\\x0cflash, as if lifted by a new strength and resolve, he leaped.\\r\\n    No great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head\\r\\nhe jumped, seven feet forward and three in the air; indeed, had he known it, he\\r\\nonly just missed cracking his skull on the low arch of the passage.\\r\\n    Gollum threw himself backwards, and grabbed as the hobbit flew over him,\\r\\nbut too late: his hands snapped on thin air, and Bilbo, falling fair on his sturdy\\r\\nfeet, sped off down the new tunnel. He did not turn to see what Gollum was\\r\\ndoing. There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at first, then it\\r\\nstopped. All at once there came a blood-curdling shriek, filled with hatred and\\r\\ndespair. Gollum was defeated. He dared go no further. He had lost: lost his prey,\\r\\nand lost, too, the only thing he had ever cared for, his precious. The cry brought\\r\\nBilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart to his mouth, but still he held on. Now faint as an echo, but\\r\\nmenacing, the voice came behind:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThief, thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it for ever!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then there was a silence. But that too seemed menacing to Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf goblins\\r\\nare so near that he smelt them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have heard his\\r\\nshrieking and cursing. Careful now, or this way will lead you to worse things.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The passage was low and roughly made. It was not too difficult for the\\r\\nhobbit, except when, in spite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes again, several\\r\\ntimes, on nasty jagged stones in the floor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA bit low for goblins, at least for the\\r\\nbig ones,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Bilbo, not knowing that even the big ones, the orcs of the\\r\\nmountains, go along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n    Soon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and after\\r\\na while it climbed steeply. That slowed Bilbo down. But at last the slope\\r\\nstopped, the passage turned a corner and dipped down again, and there, at the\\r\\nbottom of a short incline, he saw, filtering round another corner\\xe2\\x80\\x94a glimpse of\\r\\nlight. Not red light, as of fire or lantern, but a pale out-of-doors sort of light.\\r\\nThen Bilbo began to run.\\r\\n    Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and\\r\\ncame suddenly right into an open space, where the light, after all that time in the\\r\\ndark, seemed dazzlingly bright. Really it was only a leak of sunshine in through\\r\\na doorway, where a great door, a stone door, was left standing open.\\r\\n    Bilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full armour\\r\\nwith drawn swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes,\\r\\nand watching the passage that led to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n\\x0c     They saw him sooner than he saw them. Yes, they saw him. Whether it was\\r\\nan accident, or a last trick of the ring before it took a new master, it was not on\\r\\nhis finger. With yells of delight the goblins rushed upon him.\\r\\n     A pang of fear and loss, like an echo of Gollum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s misery, smote Bilbo, and\\r\\nforgetting even to draw his sword he struck his hands into his pockets. And there\\r\\nwas the ring still, in his left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. The goblins\\r\\nstopped short. They could not see a sign of him. He had vanished. They yelled\\r\\ntwice as loud as before, but not so delightedly.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo back up the passage!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d some shouted.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis way!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d some yelled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat way!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d others yelled.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook out for the door,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d bellowed the captain.\\r\\n     Whistles blew, armour clashed, swords rattled, goblins cursed and swore and\\r\\nran hither and thither, falling over one another and getting very angry. There was\\r\\na terrible outcry, to-do, and disturbance.\\r\\n     Bilbo was dreadfully frightened, but he had the sense to understand what had\\r\\nhappened and to sneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the goblin-\\r\\nguards, and so get out of the way and avoid being bumped into, trampled to\\r\\ndeath, or caught by feel.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must get to the door, I must get to the door!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he kept on saying to himself,\\r\\nbut it was a long time before he ventured to try. Then it was like a horrible game\\r\\nof blind-man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s-buff. The place was full of goblins running about, and the poor\\r\\nlittle hobbit dodged this way and that, was knocked over by a goblin who could\\r\\nnot make out what he had bumped into, scrambled away on all fours, slipped\\r\\nbetween the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door.\\r\\n     It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it nearly to. Bilbo struggled but he\\r\\ncould not move it. He tried to squeeze through the crack. He squeezed and\\r\\nsqueezed, and he stuck! It was awful. His buttons had got wedged on the edge of\\r\\nthe door and the door-post. He could see outside into the open air: there were a\\r\\nfew steps running down into a narrow valley between tall mountains; the sun\\r\\ncame out from behind a cloud and shone bright on the outside of the door\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\r\\nhe could not get through.\\r\\n     Suddenly one of the goblins inside shouted: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a shadow by the door.\\r\\nSomething is outside!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart jumped into his mouth. He gave a terrific squirm. Buttons burst\\r\\noff in all directions. He was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping\\r\\ndown the steps like a goat, while bewildered goblins were still picking up his\\r\\n\\x0cnice brass buttons on the doorstep.\\r\\n   Of course they soon came down after him, hooting and hallooing, and\\r\\nhunting among the trees. But they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the sun: it makes their legs wobble\\r\\nand their heads giddy. They could not find Bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and\\r\\nout of the shadow of the trees, running quick and quiet, and keeping out of the\\r\\nsun; so soon they went back grumbling and cursing to guard the door. Bilbo had\\r\\nescaped.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter VI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOUT OF THE FRYING-PAN INTO THE FIRE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. He had lost\\r\\nhood, cloak, food, pony, his buttons and his friends. He wandered on and on, till\\r\\nthe sun began to sink westwards\\xe2\\x80\\x94behind the mountains. Their shadows fell\\r\\nacross Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s path, and he looked back. Then he looked forward and could see\\r\\nbefore him only ridges and slopes falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed\\r\\noccasionally between the trees.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI seem to have got right to the other side of\\r\\nthe Misty Mountains, right to the edge of the Land Beyond! Where and O where\\r\\ncan Gandalf and the dwarves have got to? I only hope to goodness they are not\\r\\nstill back there in the power of the goblins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    He still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down the\\r\\nslopes beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing\\r\\ninside him. He wondered whether he ought not, now he had the magic ring, to go\\r\\nback into the horrible, horrible, tunnels and look for his friends. He had just\\r\\nmade up his mind that it was his duty, that he must turn back\\xe2\\x80\\x94and very\\r\\nmiserable he felt about it\\xe2\\x80\\x94when he heard voices.\\r\\n    He stopped and listened. It did not sound like goblins; so he crept forward\\r\\ncarefully. He was on a stony path winding downwards with a rocky wall on the\\r\\nleft hand; on the other side the ground sloped away and there were dells below\\r\\nthe level of the path overhung with bushes and low trees. In one of these dells\\r\\nunder the bushes people were talking.\\r\\n    He crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between two big boulders a\\r\\nhead with a red hood on: it was Balin doing look-out. He could have clapped and\\r\\nshouted for joy, but he did not. He had still got the ring on, for fear of meeting\\r\\nsomething unexpected and unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was looking\\r\\n\\x0cstraight at him without noticing him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will give them all a surprise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought, as he crawled into the bushes at\\r\\nthe edge of the dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They were\\r\\ndiscussing all that had happened to them in the tunnels, and wondering and\\r\\ndebating what they were to do now. The dwarves were grumbling, and Gandalf\\r\\nwas saying that they could not possibly go on with their journey leaving Mr.\\r\\nBaggins in the hands of the goblins, without trying to find out if he was alive or\\r\\ndead, and without trying to rescue him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter all he is my friend,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand not a bad little chap. I feel\\r\\nresponsible for him. I wish to goodness you had not lost him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The dwarves wanted to know why he had ever been brought at all, why he\\r\\ncould not stick to his friends and come along with them, and why the wizard had\\r\\nnot chosen someone with more sense. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has been more trouble than use so\\r\\nfar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf we have got to go back now into those abominable tunnels to\\r\\nlook for him, then drat him, I say.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Gandalf answered angrily: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI brought him, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring things that are of\\r\\nno use. Either you help me to look for him, or I go and leave you here to get out\\r\\nof the mess as best you can yourselves. If we can only find him again, you will\\r\\nthank me before all is over. Whatever did you want to go and drop him for,\\r\\nDori?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou would have dropped him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dori, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif a goblin had suddenly grabbed\\r\\nyour legs from behind in the dark, tripped up your feet, and kicked you in the\\r\\nback!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you pick him up again?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood heavens! Can you ask! Goblins fighting and biting in the dark,\\r\\neverybody falling over bodies and hitting one another! You nearly chopped off\\r\\nmy head with Glamdring, and Thorin was stabbing here there and everywhere\\r\\nwith Orcrist. All of a sudden you gave one of your blinding flashes, and we saw\\r\\nthe goblins running back yelping. You shouted \\xe2\\x80\\x98follow me everybody!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and\\r\\neverybody ought to have followed. We thought everybody had. There was no\\r\\ntime to count, as you know quite well, till we had dashed through the gate-\\r\\nguards, out of the lower door, and helter-skelter down here. And here we are\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nwithout the burglar, confusticate him!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the burglar!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo stepping down into the middle of them,\\r\\nand slipping off the ring.\\r\\n    Bless me, how they jumped! Then they shouted with surprise and delight.\\r\\nGandalf was as astonished as any of them, but probably more pleased than all\\r\\n\\x0cthe others. He called to Balin and told him what he thought of a look-out man\\r\\nwho let people walk right into them like that without warning. It is a fact that\\r\\nBilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reputation went up a very great deal with the dwarves after this. If they\\r\\nhad still doubted that he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of Gandalf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwords, they doubted no longer. Balin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone\\r\\nsaid it was a very clever bit of work.\\r\\n    Indeed Bilbo was so pleased with their praise that he just chuckled inside and\\r\\nsaid nothing whatever about the ring; and when they asked him how he did it, he\\r\\nsaid: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, just crept along, you know\\xe2\\x80\\x94very carefully and quietly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, it is the first time that even a mouse has crept along carefully and\\r\\nquietly under my very nose and not been spotted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I take off my\\r\\nhood to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Which he did.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBalin at your service,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour servant, Mr. Baggins,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo.\\r\\n    Then they wanted to know all about his adventures after they had lost him,\\r\\nand he sat down and told them everything\\xe2\\x80\\x94except about the finding of the ring\\r\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot just now\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought). They were particularly interested in the riddle-\\r\\ncompetition, and shuddered most appreciatively at his description of Gollum.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of any other question with him sitting beside me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nended Bilbo; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso I said \\xe2\\x80\\x98what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in my pocket?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 And he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t guess in three\\r\\ngoes. So I said: \\xe2\\x80\\x98what about your promise? Show me the way out!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 But he came\\r\\nat me to kill me, and I ran, and fell over, and he missed me in the dark. Then I\\r\\nfollowed him, because I heard him talking to himself. He thought I really knew\\r\\nthe way out, and so he was making for it. And then he sat down in the entrance,\\r\\nand I could not get by. So I jumped over him and escaped, and ran down to the\\r\\ngate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about the guards?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there any?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO yes! lots of them; but I dodged \\xe2\\x80\\x99em. I got stuck in the door, which was\\r\\nonly open a crack, and I lost lots of buttons,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said sadly looking at his torn\\r\\nclothes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I squeezed through all right\\xe2\\x80\\x94and here I am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The dwarves looked at him with quite a new respect, when he talked about\\r\\ndodging guards, jumping over Gollum, and squeezing through, as if it was not\\r\\nvery difficult or very alarming.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did I tell you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf laughing. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Baggins has more about\\r\\nhim than you guess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy\\r\\neyebrows, as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of\\r\\nhis tale that he had left out.\\r\\n\\x0c    Then he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all\\r\\nby now to the dwarves, Bilbo had not heard it. He wanted to know how the\\r\\nwizard had turned up again, and where they had all got to now.\\r\\n    The wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more\\r\\nthan once, so now he told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of\\r\\nthe presence of evil goblins in that part of the mountains. But their main gate\\r\\nused to come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they\\r\\noften caught people benighted near their gates. Evidently people had given up\\r\\ngoing that way, and the goblins must have opened their new entrance at the top\\r\\nof the pass the dwarves had taken, quite recently, because it had been found quite\\r\\nsafe up to now.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must see if I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find a more or less decent giant to block it up again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Gandalf, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor soon there will be no getting over the mountains at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    As soon as Gandalf had heard Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yell he realized what had happened. In\\r\\nthe flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside\\r\\nthe crack, just as it snapped to. He followed after the drivers and prisoners right\\r\\nto the edge of the great hall, and there he sat down and worked up the best magic\\r\\nhe could in the shadows.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA very ticklish business, it was,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTouch and go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    But, of course, Gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire\\r\\nand lights (even the hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at Old\\r\\nTook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s midsummer-eve parties, as you remember). The rest we all know\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nexcept that Gandalf knew all about the back-door, as the goblins called the lower\\r\\ngate, where Bilbo lost his buttons. As a matter of fact it was well known to\\r\\nanybody who was acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it took a\\r\\nwizard to keep his head in the tunnels and guide them in the right direction.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey made that gate ages ago,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpartly for a way of escape, if they\\r\\nneeded one; partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where they still come in\\r\\nthe dark and do great damage. They guard it always and no one has ever\\r\\nmanaged to block it up. They will guard it doubly after this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he laughed.\\r\\n    All the others laughed too. After all they had lost a good deal, but they had\\r\\nkilled the Great Goblin and a great many others besides, and they had all\\r\\nescaped, so they might be said to have had the best of it so far.\\r\\n    But the wizard called them to their senses. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must be getting on at once,\\r\\nnow we are a little rested,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey will be out after us in hundreds when\\r\\nnight comes on; and already shadows are lengthening. They can smell our\\r\\nfootsteps for hours and hours after we have passed. We must be miles on before\\r\\n\\x0cdusk. There will be a bit of moon, if it keeps fine, and that is lucky. Not that they\\r\\nmind the moon much, but it will give us a little light to steer by.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO yes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in answer to more questions from the hobbit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou lose\\r\\ntrack of time inside goblin-tunnels. Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Thursday, and it was Monday night\\r\\nor Tuesday morning that we were captured. We have gone miles and miles, and\\r\\ncome right down through the heart of the mountains, and are now on the other\\r\\nside\\xe2\\x80\\x94quite a short cut. But we are not at the point to which our pass would have\\r\\nbrought us; we are too far to the North, and have some awkward country ahead.\\r\\nAnd we are still pretty high up. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get on!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am dreadfully hungry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d groaned Bilbo, who was suddenly aware that he\\r\\nhad not had a meal since the night before the night before last. Just think of that\\r\\nfor a hobbit! His stomach felt all empty and loose and his legs all wobbly, now\\r\\nthat the excitement was over.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunless you like to go back and ask the goblins\\r\\nnicely to let you have your pony back and your luggage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo thank you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well then, we must just tighten our belts and trudge on\\xe2\\x80\\x94or we shall be\\r\\nmade into supper, and that will be much worse than having none ourselves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    As they went on Bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat; but the\\r\\nblackberries were still only in flower, and of course there were no nuts, not even\\r\\nhawthorn-berries. He nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a small\\r\\nmountain-stream that crossed the path, and he ate three wild strawberries that he\\r\\nfound on its bank, but it was not much good.\\r\\n    They still went on and on. The rough path disappeared. The bushes, and the\\r\\nlong grasses between the boulders, the patches of rabbit-cropped turf, the thyme\\r\\nand the sage and the marjoram, and the yellow rockroses all vanished, and they\\r\\nfound themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the remains of\\r\\na landslide. When they began to go down this, rubbish and small pebbles rolled\\r\\naway from their feet; soon larger bits of split stone went clattering down and\\r\\nstarted other pieces below them slithering and rolling; then lumps of rock were\\r\\ndisturbed and bounded off, crashing down with a dust and a noise. Before long\\r\\nthe whole slope above them and below them seemed on the move, and they were\\r\\nsliding away, huddled all together, in a fearful confusion of slipping, rattling,\\r\\ncracking slabs and stones.\\r\\n    It was the trees at the bottom that saved them. They slid into the edge of a\\r\\nclimbing wood of pines that here stood right up the mountain slope from the\\r\\ndeeper darker forests of the valleys below. Some caught hold of the trunks and\\r\\n\\x0cswung themselves into lower branches, some (like the little hobbit) got behind a\\r\\ntree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the\\r\\nslide had stopped, and the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of the\\r\\ndisturbed stones went bounding and spinning among the bracken and the pine-\\r\\nroots far below.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell! that has got us on a bit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand even goblins tracking us\\r\\nwill have a job to come down here quietly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI daresay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grumbled Bombur; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find it difficult to send stones\\r\\nbouncing down on our heads.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The dwarves (and Bilbo) were feeling far from\\r\\nhappy, and were rubbing their bruised and damaged legs and feet.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsense! We are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide. We\\r\\nmust be quick! Look at the light!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The sun had long gone behind the mountains. Already the shadows were\\r\\ndeepening about them, though far away through the trees and over the black tops\\r\\nof those growing lower down they could still see the evening lights on the plains\\r\\nbeyond. They limped along now as fast as they were able down the gentle slopes\\r\\nof a pine forest in a slanting path leading steadily southwards. At times they\\r\\nwere pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the\\r\\nhobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head; at times they were marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of\\r\\npine-needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got heavier and the forest-\\r\\nsilence deeper. There was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-sighing into\\r\\nthe branches of the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMust we go any further?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only\\r\\njust see Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the\\r\\ndwarves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 breathing like a loud noise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy toes are all bruised and bent, and my\\r\\nlegs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA bit further,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf.\\r\\n    After what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no\\r\\ntrees grew. The moon was up and was shining into the clearing. Somehow it\\r\\nstruck all of them as not at all a nice place, although there was nothing wrong to\\r\\nsee.\\r\\n    All of a sudden they heard a howl away down hill, a long shuddering howl. It\\r\\nwas answered by another away to the right and a good deal nearer to them; then\\r\\nby another not far away to the left. It was wolves howling at the moon, wolves\\r\\ngathering together!\\r\\n\\x0c     There were no wolves living near Mr. Baggins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hole at home, but he knew\\r\\nthat noise. He had had it described to him often enough in tales. One of his elder\\r\\ncousins (on the Took side), who had been a great traveller, used to imitate it to\\r\\nfrighten him. To hear it out in the forest under the moon was too much for Bilbo.\\r\\nEven magic rings are not much use against wolves\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially against the evil\\r\\npacks that lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested mountains, over the\\r\\nEdge of the Wild on the borders of the unknown. Wolves of that sort smell\\r\\nkeener than goblins, and do not need to see you to catch you!\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat shall we do, what shall we do!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEscaping goblins to be\\r\\ncaught by wolves!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, and it became a proverb, though we now say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cout of\\r\\nthe frying-pan into the fire\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the same sort of uncomfortable situations.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUp the trees quick!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of\\r\\nthe glade, hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough\\r\\nto swarm up. They found them as quick as ever they could, you can guess; and\\r\\nup they went as high as ever they could trust the branches. You would have\\r\\nlaughed (from a safe distance), if you had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees\\r\\nwith their beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at\\r\\nbeing boys. Fili and Kili were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous\\r\\nChristmas tree. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were more comfortable in a huge\\r\\npine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a wheel.\\r\\nBifur, Bofur, Bombur, and Thorin were in another. Dwalin and Balin had\\r\\nswarmed up a tall slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to\\r\\nsit in the greenery of the topmost boughs. Gandalf, who was a good deal taller\\r\\nthan the others, had found a tree into which they could not climb, a large pine\\r\\nstanding at the very edge of the glade. He was quite hidden in its boughs, but\\r\\nyou could see his eyes gleaming in the moon as he peeped out.\\r\\n     And Bilbo? He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from\\r\\ntrunk to trunk, like a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog after it.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve left the burglar behind again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nori to Dori looking down.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be always carrying burglars on my back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dori, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdown tunnels\\r\\nand up trees! What do you think I am? A porter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be eaten if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do something,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, for there were howls\\r\\nall round them now, getting nearer and nearer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDori!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called, for Dori was\\r\\nlowest down in the easiest tree, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbe quick, and give Mr. Baggins a hand up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     Dori was really a decent fellow in spite of his grumbling. Poor Bilbo could\\r\\nnot reach his hand even when he climbed down to the bottom branch and hung\\r\\nhis arm down as far as ever he could. So Dori actually climbed out of the tree\\r\\n\\x0cand let Bilbo scramble up and stand on his back.\\r\\n    Just at that moment the wolves trotted howling into the clearing. All of a\\r\\nsudden there were hundreds of eyes looking at them. Still Dori did not let Bilbo\\r\\ndown. He waited till he had clambered off his shoulders into the branches, and\\r\\nthen he jumped for the branches himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped at\\r\\nhis cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. In a minute there was a whole\\r\\npack of them yelping all round the tree and leaping up at the trunk, with eyes\\r\\nblazing and tongues hanging out.\\r\\n    But even the wild Wargs (for so the evil wolves over the Edge of the Wild\\r\\nwere named) cannot climb trees. For a time they were safe. Luckily it was warm\\r\\nand not windy. Trees are not very comfortable to sit in for long at any time; but\\r\\nin the cold and the wind, with wolves all round below waiting for you, they can\\r\\nbe perfectly miserable places.\\r\\n    This glade in the ring of trees was evidently a meeting-place of the wolves.\\r\\nMore and more kept coming in. They left guards at the foot of the tree in which\\r\\nDori and Bilbo were, and then went snuffling about till they had smelt out every\\r\\ntree that had anyone in it. These they guarded too, while all the rest (hundreds\\r\\nand hundreds it seemed) went and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the\\r\\nmiddle of the circle was a great grey wolf. He spoke to them in the dreadful\\r\\nlanguage of the Wargs. Gandalf understood it. Bilbo did not, but it sounded\\r\\nterrible to him, and as if all their talk was about cruel and wicked things, as it\\r\\nwas. Every now and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their grey\\r\\nchief all together, and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of\\r\\nhis pine-tree.\\r\\n    I will tell you what Gandalf heard, though Bilbo did not understand it. The\\r\\nWargs and the goblins often helped one another in wicked deeds. Goblins do not\\r\\nusually venture very far from their mountains, unless they are driven out and are\\r\\nlooking for new homes, or are marching to war (which I am glad to say has not\\r\\nhappened for a long while). But in those days they sometimes used to go on\\r\\nraids, especially to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they often got the\\r\\nWargs to help and shared the plunder with them. Sometimes they rode on wolves\\r\\nlike men do on horses. Now it seemed that a great goblin-raid had been planned\\r\\nfor that very night. The Wargs had come to meet the goblins and the goblins\\r\\nwere late. The reason, no doubt, was the death of the Great Goblin, and all the\\r\\nexcitement caused by the dwarves and Bilbo and the wizard, for whom they\\r\\nwere probably still hunting.\\r\\n    In spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their\\r\\n\\x0cway back into it from the South, cutting down trees, and building themselves\\r\\nplaces to live in among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the\\r\\nriver-shores. There were many of them, and they were brave and well-armed,\\r\\nand even the Wargs dared not attack them if there were many together, or in the\\r\\nbright day. But now they had planned with the goblins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 help to come by night\\r\\nupon some of the villages nearest the mountains. If their plan had been carried\\r\\nout, there would have been none left there next day; all would have been killed\\r\\nexcept the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back as prisoners to\\r\\ntheir caves.\\r\\n    This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen\\r\\nand their wives and children, but also because of the danger which now\\r\\nthreatened Gandalf and his friends. The Wargs were angry and puzzled at finding\\r\\nthem here in their very meeting-place. They thought they were friends of the\\r\\nwoodmen, and were come to spy on them, and would take news of their plans\\r\\ndown into the valleys, and then the goblins and the wolves would have to fight a\\r\\nterrible battle instead of capturing prisoners and devouring people waked\\r\\nsuddenly from their sleep. So the Wargs had no intention of going away and\\r\\nletting the people up the trees escape, at any rate not until morning. And long\\r\\nbefore that, they said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the\\r\\nmountains; and goblins can climb trees, or cut them down.\\r\\n    Now you can understand why Gandalf, listening to their growling and\\r\\nyelping, began to be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and to feel that\\r\\nthey were in a very bad place, and had not yet escaped at all. All the same he\\r\\nwas not going to let them have it all their own way, though he could not do very\\r\\nmuch stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all round on the ground below. He\\r\\ngathered the huge pine-cones from the branches of the tree. Then he set one\\r\\nalight with bright blue fire, and threw it whizzing down among the circle of the\\r\\nwolves. It struck one on the back, and immediately his shaggy coat caught fire,\\r\\nand he was leaping to and fro yelping horribly. Then another came and another,\\r\\none in blue flames, one in red, another in green. They burst on the ground in the\\r\\nmiddle of the circle and went off in coloured sparks and smoke. A specially large\\r\\none hit the chief wolf on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten feet, and then\\r\\nrushed round and round the circle biting and snapping even at the other wolves\\r\\nin his anger and fright.\\r\\n    The dwarves and Bilbo shouted and cheered. The rage of the wolves was\\r\\nterrible to see, and the commotion they made filled all the forest. Wolves are\\r\\nafraid of fire at all times, but this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. If a\\r\\n\\x0cspark got in their coats it stuck and burned into them, and unless they rolled over\\r\\nquick they were soon all in flames. Very soon all about the glade wolves were\\r\\nrolling over and over to put out the sparks on their backs, while those that were\\r\\nburning were running about howling and setting others alight, till their own\\r\\nfriends chased them away and they fled off down the slopes crying and\\r\\nyammering and looking for water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is all this uproar in the forest tonight?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Lord of the Eagles. He\\r\\nwas sitting, black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely pinnacle of rock at the\\r\\neastern edge of the mountains. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hear wolves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 voices! Are the goblins at\\r\\nmischief in the woods?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    He swept up into the air, and immediately two of his guards from the rocks at\\r\\neither hand leaped up to follow him. They circled up in the sky and looked down\\r\\nupon the ring of the Wargs, a tiny spot far far below. But eagles have keen eyes\\r\\nand can see small things at a great distance. The Lord of the Eagles of the Misty\\r\\nMountains had eyes that could look at the sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit\\r\\nmoving on the ground a mile below even in the moonlight. So though he could\\r\\nnot see the people in the trees, he could make out the commotion among the\\r\\nwolves and see the tiny flashes of fire, and hear the howling and yelping come\\r\\nup faint from far beneath him. Also he could see the glint of the moon on goblin\\r\\nspears and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides\\r\\nfrom their gate and wound into the wood.\\r\\n    Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But the ancient\\r\\nrace of the northern mountains were the greatest of all birds; they were proud\\r\\nand strong and noble-hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear them. When\\r\\nthey took any notice of them at all (which was seldom, for they did not eat such\\r\\ncreatures), they swooped on them and drove them shrieking back to their caves,\\r\\nand stopped whatever wickedness they were doing. The goblins hated the eagles\\r\\nand feared them, but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive them from the\\r\\nmountains.\\r\\n    Tonight the Lord of the Eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was\\r\\nafoot; so he summoned many other eagles to him, and they flew away from the\\r\\nmountains, and slowly circling ever round and round they came down, down,\\r\\ndown towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins.\\r\\n    A very good thing too! Dreadful things had been going on down there. The\\r\\nwolves that had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several\\r\\n\\x0cplaces. It was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had\\r\\nbeen little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled\\r\\npine-needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the\\r\\nclearing of the Wargs fire was leaping. But the wolf-guards did not leave the\\r\\ntrees. Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and\\r\\ncursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out,\\r\\nand their eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames.\\r\\n    Then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. They thought a battle with\\r\\nthe woodmen was going on; but they soon learned what had really happened.\\r\\nSome of them actually sat down and laughed. Others waved their spears and\\r\\nclashed the shafts against their shields. Goblins are not afraid of fire, and they\\r\\nsoon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing.\\r\\n    Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and\\r\\nbrushwood round the tree-trunks. Others rushed round and stamped and beat,\\r\\nand beat and stamped, until nearly all the flames were put out\\xe2\\x80\\x94but they did not\\r\\nput out the fire nearest to the trees where the dwarves were. That fire they fed\\r\\nwith leaves and dead branches and bracken. Soon they had a ring of smoke and\\r\\nflame all round the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards;\\r\\nbut it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking the fuel piled under the\\r\\ntrees. Smoke was in Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes, he could feel the heat of the flames; and\\r\\nthrough the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a circle\\r\\nlike people round a midsummer bonfire. Outside the ring of dancing warriors\\r\\nwith spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and\\r\\nwaiting.\\r\\n    He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Fifteen birds in five fir-trees,\\r\\n       their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze!\\r\\n       But, funny little birds, they had no wings!\\r\\n       O what shall we do with the funny little things?\\r\\n       Roast \\xe2\\x80\\x99em alive, or stew them in a pot;\\r\\n       fry them, boil them and eat them hot?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Then they stopped and shouted out: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFly away little birds! Fly away if you\\r\\ncan! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing\\r\\nlittle birds! Why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you sing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo away! little boys!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Gandalf in answer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bird-nesting time.\\r\\nAlso naughty little boys that play with fire get punished.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He said it to make\\r\\nthem angry, and to show them he was not frightened of them\\xe2\\x80\\x94though of course\\r\\nhe was, wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they went on\\r\\nsinging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Burn, burn tree and fern!\\r\\n       Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch\\r\\n       To light the night for our delight,\\r\\n           Ya hey!\\r\\n       Bake and toast \\xe2\\x80\\x99em, fry and roast \\xe2\\x80\\x99em!\\r\\n       till beards blaze, and eyes glaze;\\r\\n       till hair smells and skins crack,\\r\\n       fat melts, and bones black\\r\\n           in cinders lie\\r\\n           beneath the sky!\\r\\n           So dwarves shall die,\\r\\n       and light the night for our delight,\\r\\n           Ya hey!\\r\\n           Ya-harri-hey!\\r\\n           Ya hoy!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   And with that Ya hoy! the flames were under Gandalf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tree. In a moment it\\r\\nspread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked.\\r\\n   Then Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. The sudden splendour flashed\\r\\nfrom his wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right\\r\\namong the spears of the goblins. That would have been the end of him, though\\r\\nhe would probably have killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a\\r\\nthunderbolt. But he never leaped.\\r\\n   Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized\\r\\nhim in his talons, and was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of\\r\\nthe Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that\\r\\n\\x0cwere with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves\\r\\nyammered and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage,\\r\\nand flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles;\\r\\nthe dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far\\r\\naway; their talons tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and\\r\\nseized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as they ever dared to go.\\r\\n    Poor little Bilbo was very nearly left behind again! He just managed to catch\\r\\nhold of Dori\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and up they went together\\r\\nabove the tumult and the burning, Bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly\\r\\nbreaking.\\r\\n    Now far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the\\r\\nwoods. A few eagles were still circling and sweeping above the battleground.\\r\\nThe flames about the trees sprang suddenly up above the highest branches. They\\r\\nwent up in crackling fire. There was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke. Bilbo\\r\\nhad escaped only just in time!\\r\\n    Soon the light of the burning was faint below, a red twinkle on the black\\r\\nfloor; and they were high up in the sky, rising all the time in strong sweeping\\r\\ncircles. Bilbo never forgot that flight, clinging onto Dori\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ankles. He moaned\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy arms, my arms!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; but Dori groaned \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy poor legs, my poor legs!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    At the best of times heights made Bilbo giddy. He used to turn queer if he\\r\\nlooked over the edge of quite a little cliff; and he had never liked ladders, let\\r\\nalone trees (never having had to escape from wolves before). So you can\\r\\nimagine how his head swam now, when he looked down between his dangling\\r\\ntoes and saw the dark lands opening wide underneath him, touched here and\\r\\nthere with the light of the moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the plains.\\r\\n    The pale peaks of the mountains were coming nearer, moonlit spikes of rock\\r\\nsticking out of black shadows. Summer or not, it seemed very cold. He shut his\\r\\neyes and wondered if he could hold on any longer. Then he imagined what\\r\\nwould happen if he did not. He felt sick.\\r\\n    The flight ended only just in time for him, just before his arms gave way. He\\r\\nloosed Dori\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ankles with a gasp and fell onto the rough platform of an eagle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\neyrie. There he lay without speaking, and his thoughts were a mixture of surprise\\r\\nat being saved from the fire, and fear lest he fall off that narrow place into the\\r\\ndeep shadows on either side. He was feeling very queer indeed in his head by\\r\\nthis time after the dreadful adventures of the last three days with next to nothing\\r\\nto eat, and he found himself saying aloud: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I know what a piece of bacon\\r\\nfeels like when it is suddenly picked out of the pan on a fork and put back on the\\r\\n\\x0cshelf!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he heard Dori answering, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause the bacon knows that it\\r\\nwill get back in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped we shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Also\\r\\neagles aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forks!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO no! Not a bit like storks\\xe2\\x80\\x94forks, I mean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo sitting up and\\r\\nlooking anxiously at the eagle who was perched close by. He wondered what\\r\\nother nonsense he had been saying, and if the eagle would think it rude. You\\r\\nought not to be rude to an eagle, when you are only the size of a hobbit, and are\\r\\nup in his eyrie at night!\\r\\n    The eagle only sharpened his beak on a stone and trimmed his feathers and\\r\\ntook no notice.\\r\\n    Soon another eagle flew up. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Lord of the Eagles bids you to bring your\\r\\nprisoners to the Great Shelf,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried and was off again. The other seized Dori\\r\\nin his claws and flew away with him into the night leaving Bilbo all alone. He\\r\\nhad just strength to wonder what the messenger had meant by \\xe2\\x80\\x98prisoners,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and to\\r\\nbegin to think of being torn up for supper like a rabbit, when his own turn came.\\r\\n    The eagle came back, seized him in his talons by the back of his coat, and\\r\\nswooped off. This time he flew only a short way. Very soon Bilbo was laid\\r\\ndown, trembling with fear, on a wide shelf of rock on the mountain-side. There\\r\\nwas no path down on to it save by flying; and no path down off it except by\\r\\njumping over a precipice. There he found all the others sitting with their backs to\\r\\nthe mountain wall. The Lord of the Eagles also was there and was speaking to\\r\\nGandalf.\\r\\n    It seemed that Bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. The wizard and the\\r\\neagle-lord appeared to know one another slightly, and even to be on friendly\\r\\nterms. As a matter of fact Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had\\r\\nonce rendered a service to the eagles and healed their lord from an arrow-wound.\\r\\nSo you see \\xe2\\x80\\x98prisoners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 had meant \\xe2\\x80\\x98prisoners rescued from the goblins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 only, and\\r\\nnot captives of the eagles. As Bilbo listened to the talk of Gandalf he realized\\r\\nthat at last they were going to escape really and truly from the dreadful\\r\\nmountains. He was discussing plans with the Great Eagle for carrying the\\r\\ndwarves and himself and Bilbo far away and setting them down well on their\\r\\njourney across the plains below.\\r\\n\\x0c  The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    The Lord of the Eagles would not take them anywhere near where men lived.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey would shoot at us with their great bows of yew,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor they would\\r\\nthink we were after their sheep. And at other times they would be right. No! we\\r\\nare glad to cheat the goblins of their sport, and glad to repay our thanks to you,\\r\\n\\x0cbut we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plains.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake us where and as far as you will! We are\\r\\nalready deeply obliged to you. But in the meantime we are famished with\\r\\nhunger.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am nearly dead of it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat can perhaps be mended,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Lord of the Eagles.\\r\\n    Later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures\\r\\nof the dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell. The eagles\\r\\nhad brought up dry boughs for fuel, and they had brought rabbits, hares, and a\\r\\nsmall sheep. The dwarves managed all the preparations. Bilbo was too weak to\\r\\nhelp, and anyway he was not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat,\\r\\nbeing used to having it delivered by the butcher all ready to cook. Gandalf, too,\\r\\nwas lying down after doing his part in setting the fire going, since Oin and Gloin\\r\\nhad lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never taken to matches even yet.)\\r\\n    So ended the adventures of the Misty Mountains. Soon Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stomach was\\r\\nfeeling full and comfortable again, and he felt he could sleep contentedly, though\\r\\nreally he would have liked a loaf and butter better than bits of meat toasted on\\r\\nsticks. He slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than ever he had done\\r\\non his feather-bed in his own little hole at home. But all night he dreamed of his\\r\\nown house and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms looking for\\r\\nsomething that he could not find nor remember what it looked like.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter VII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQUEER LODGINGS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Bilbo woke up with the early sun in his eyes. He jumped up to\\r\\nlook at the time and to go and put his kettle on\\xe2\\x80\\x94and found he was not home at\\r\\nall. So he sat down and wished in vain for a wash and a brush. He did not get\\r\\neither, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for his breakfast, only cold mutton and rabbit.\\r\\nAnd after that he had to get ready for a fresh start.\\r\\n    This time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back and cling between\\r\\nhis wings. The air rushed over him and he shut his eyes. The dwarves were\\r\\ncrying farewells and promising to repay the Lord of the Eagles if ever they\\r\\ncould, as off rose fifteen great birds from the mountain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side. The sun was still\\r\\nclose to the eastern edge of things. The morning was cool, and mists were in the\\r\\nvalleys and hollows and twined here and there about the peaks and pinnacles of\\r\\nthe hills. Bilbo opened an eye to peep and saw that the birds were already high\\r\\nup and the world was far away, and the mountains were falling back behind them\\r\\ninto the distance. He shut his eyes again and held on tighter.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pinch!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said his eagle. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou need not be frightened like a rabbit, even\\r\\nif you look rather like one. It is a fair morning with little wind. What is finer than\\r\\nflying?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Bilbo would have liked to say: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA warm bath and late breakfast on the lawn\\r\\nafterwards;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but he thought it better to say nothing at all, and to let go his clutch\\r\\njust a tiny bit.\\r\\n    After a good while the eagles must have seen the point they were making for,\\r\\neven from their great height, for they began to go down circling round in great\\r\\nspirals. They did this for a long while, and at last the hobbit opened his eyes\\r\\nagain. The earth was much nearer, and below them were trees that looked like\\r\\noaks and elms, and wide grass lands, and a river running through it all. But\\r\\n\\x0ccropping out of the ground, right in the path of the stream which looped itself\\r\\nabout it, was a great rock, almost a hill of stone, like a last outpost of the distant\\r\\nmountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the plain by some giant among giants.\\r\\n    Quickly now to the top of this rock the eagles swooped one by one and set\\r\\ndown their passengers.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarewell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwherever you fare, till your eyries receive you at the\\r\\njourney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d That is the polite thing to say among eagles.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon\\r\\nwalks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Gandalf, who knew the correct reply.\\r\\n    And so they parted. And though the Lord of the Eagles became in after days\\r\\nthe King of All Birds and wore a golden crown, and his fifteen chieftains golden\\r\\ncollars (made of the gold that the dwarves gave them), Bilbo never saw them\\r\\nagain\\xe2\\x80\\x94except high and far off in the battle of Five Armies. But as that comes in\\r\\nat the end of this tale we will say no more about it just now.\\r\\n    There was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path\\r\\nwith many steps leading down it to the river, across which a ford of huge flat\\r\\nstones led to the grass-land beyond the stream. There was a little cave (a\\r\\nwholesome one with a pebbly floor) at the foot of the steps and near the end of\\r\\nthe stony ford. Here the party gathered and discussed what was to be done.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI always meant to see you all safe (if possible) over the mountains,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nwizard, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand now by good management and good luck I have done it. Indeed we\\r\\nare now a good deal further east than I ever meant to come with you, for after all\\r\\nthis is not my adventure. I may look in on it again before it is all over, but in the\\r\\nmeanwhile I have some other pressing business to attend to.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The dwarves groaned and looked most distressed, and Bilbo wept. They had\\r\\nbegun to think Gandalf was going to come all the way and would always be\\r\\nthere to help them out of difficulties. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not going to disappear this very\\r\\ninstant,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can give you a day or two more. Probably I can help you out\\r\\nof your present plight, and I need a little help myself. We have no food, and no\\r\\nbaggage, and no ponies to ride; and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where you are. Now I can\\r\\ntell you that. You are still some miles north of the path which we should have\\r\\nbeen following, if we had not left the mountain pass in a hurry. Very few people\\r\\nlive in these parts, unless they have come here since I was last down this way,\\r\\nwhich is some years ago. But there is somebody that I know of, who lives not far\\r\\naway. That Somebody made the steps on the great rock\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Carrock I believe\\r\\nhe calls it. He does not come here often, certainly not in the daytime, and it is no\\r\\ngood waiting for him. In fact it would be very dangerous. We must go and find\\r\\n\\x0chim; and if all goes well at our meeting, I think I shall be off and wish you like\\r\\nthe eagles \\xe2\\x80\\x98farewell wherever you fare!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    They begged him not to leave them. They offered him dragon-gold and silver\\r\\nand jewels, but he would not change his mind. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shall see, we shall see!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I think I have earned already some of your dragon-gold\\xe2\\x80\\x94when you\\r\\nhave got it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that they stopped pleading. Then they took off their clothes and bathed in\\r\\nthe river, which was shallow and clear and stony at the ford. When they had\\r\\ndried in the sun, which was now strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still\\r\\nsore and a little hungry. Soon they crossed the ford (carrying the hobbit), and\\r\\nthen began to march through the long green grass and down the lines of the\\r\\nwide-armed oaks and the tall elms.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd why is it called the Carrock?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo as he went along at the\\r\\nwizard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe called it the Carrock, because carrock is his word for it. He calls things\\r\\nlike that carrocks, and this one is the Carrock because it is the only one near his\\r\\nhome and he knows it well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho calls it? Who knows it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Somebody I spoke of\\xe2\\x80\\x94a very great person. You must all be very polite\\r\\nwhen I introduce you. I shall introduce you slowly, two by two, I think; and you\\r\\nmust be careful not to annoy him, or heaven knows what will happen. He can be\\r\\nappalling when he is angry, though he is kind enough if humoured. Still I warn\\r\\nyou he gets angry easily.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The dwarves all gathered round when they heard the wizard talking like this\\r\\nto Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that the person you are taking us to now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they asked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou find someone more easy-tempered? Hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you better explain it all a bit\\r\\nclearer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so on.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes it certainly is! No I could not! And I was explaining very carefully,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nanswered the wizard crossly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you must know more, his name is Beorn. He is\\r\\nvery strong, and he is a skin-changer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies, when he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn their\\r\\nskins into squirrels?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a fool\\r\\nMr. Baggins if you can help it; and in the name of all wonder don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention the\\r\\nword furrier again as long as you are within a hundred miles of his house, nor\\r\\n\\x0crug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any other such unfortunate word! He is a skin-\\r\\nchanger. He changes his skin: sometimes he is a huge black bear, sometimes he\\r\\nis a great strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. I cannot tell\\r\\nyou much more, though that ought to be enough. Some say that he is a bear\\r\\ndescended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains that lived there\\r\\nbefore the giants came. Others say that he is a man descended from the first men\\r\\nwho lived before Smaug or the other dragons came into this part of the world,\\r\\nand before the goblins came into the hills out of the North. I cannot say, though I\\r\\nfancy the last is the true tale. He is not the sort of person to ask questions of.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt any rate he is under no enchantment but his own. He lives in an oak-\\r\\nwood and has a great wooden house; and as a man he keeps cattle and horses\\r\\nwhich are nearly as marvellous as himself. They work for him and talk to him.\\r\\nHe does not eat them; neither does he hunt or eat wild animals. He keeps hives\\r\\nand hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on cream and honey. As a bear he\\r\\nranges far and wide. I once saw him sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock at\\r\\nnight watching the moon sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and I heard him\\r\\ngrowl in the tongue of bears: \\xe2\\x80\\x98The day will come when they will perish and I\\r\\nshall go back!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 That is why I believe he once came from the mountains himself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about, and they asked no more\\r\\nquestions. They still had a long way to walk before them. Up slope and down\\r\\ndale they plodded. It grew very hot. Sometimes they rested under the trees, and\\r\\nthen Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have eaten acorns, if any had been ripe\\r\\nenough yet to have fallen to the ground.\\r\\n   It was the middle of the afternoon before they noticed that great patches of\\r\\nflowers had begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing together as if they\\r\\nhad been planted. Especially there was clover, waving patches of cockscomb\\r\\nclover, and purple clover, and wide stretches of short white sweet honey-\\r\\nsmelling clover. There was a buzzing and a whirring and a droning in the air.\\r\\nBees were busy everywhere. And such bees! Bilbo had never seen anything like\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf one was to sting me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should swell up as big again as I\\r\\nam!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   They were bigger than hornets. The drones were bigger than your thumb, a\\r\\ngood deal, and the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies shone like fiery\\r\\ngold.\\r\\n\\x0c   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are getting near,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are on the edge of his bee-\\r\\npastures.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while they came to a belt of tall and very ancient oaks, and beyond these\\r\\nto a high thorn-hedge through which you could neither see nor scramble.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better wait here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard to the dwarves; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand when I call\\r\\nor whistle begin to come after me\\xe2\\x80\\x94you will see the way I go\\xe2\\x80\\x94but only in pairs,\\r\\nmind, about five minutes between each pair of you. Bombur is fattest and will do\\r\\nfor two, he had better come alone and last. Come on Mr. Baggins! There is a\\r\\ngate somewhere round this way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And with that he went off along the hedge\\r\\ntaking the frightened hobbit with him.\\r\\n    They soon came to a wooden gate, high and broad, beyond which they could\\r\\nsee gardens and a cluster of low wooden buildings, some thatched and made of\\r\\nunshaped logs: barns, stables, sheds, and a long low wooden house. Inside on the\\r\\nsouthward side of the great hedge were rows and rows of hives with bell-shaped\\r\\ntops made of straw. The noise of the giant bees flying to and fro and crawling in\\r\\nand out filled all the air.\\r\\n    The wizard and the hobbit pushed open the heavy creaking gate and went\\r\\ndown a wide track towards the house. Some horses, very sleek and well-\\r\\ngroomed, trotted up across the grass and looked at them intently with very\\r\\nintelligent faces; then off they galloped to the buildings.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf.\\r\\n    Soon they reached a courtyard, three walls of which were formed by the\\r\\nwooden house and its two long wings. In the middle there was lying a great oak-\\r\\ntrunk with many lopped branches beside it. Standing near was a huge man with a\\r\\nthick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with knotted muscles.\\r\\nHe was clothed in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was leaning on a large\\r\\naxe. The horses were standing by him with their noses at his shoulder.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUgh! here they are!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to the horses. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look dangerous. You\\r\\ncan be off!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He laughed a great rolling laugh, put down his axe and came\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you and what do you want?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked gruffly, standing in front of\\r\\nthem and towering tall above Gandalf. As for Bilbo he could easily have trotted\\r\\nthrough his legs without ducking his head to miss the fringe of the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brown\\r\\ntunic.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am Gandalf,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard.\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever heard of him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled the man. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this little fellow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid, stooping down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy black eyebrows.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable\\r\\nreputation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. Bilbo bowed. He had no hat to take off, and was\\r\\npainfully conscious of his many missing buttons. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am a wizard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d continued\\r\\nGandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have heard of you, if you have not heard of me; but perhaps you\\r\\nhave heard of my good cousin Radagast who lives near the Southern borders of\\r\\nMirkwood?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes; not a bad fellow as wizards go, I believe. I used to see him now and\\r\\nagain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, now I know who you are, or who you say you are.\\r\\nWhat do you want?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo tell you the truth, we have lost our luggage and nearly lost our way, and\\r\\nare rather in need of help, or at least of advice. I may say we have had rather a\\r\\nbad time with goblins in the mountains.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoblins?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the big man less gruffly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO ho, so you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been having\\r\\ntrouble with them have you? What did you go near them for?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe did not mean to. They surprised us at night in a pass which we had to\\r\\ncross; we were coming out of the Lands over West into these countries\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is a\\r\\nlong tale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen you had better come inside and tell me some of it, if it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take all\\r\\nday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the man leading the way through a dark door that opened out of the\\r\\ncourtyard into the house.\\r\\n    Following him they found themselves in a wide hall with a fire-place in the\\r\\nmiddle. Though it was summer there was a wood-fire burning and the smoke\\r\\nwas rising to the blackened rafters in search of the way out through an opening\\r\\nin the roof. They passed through this dim hall, lit only by the fire and the hole\\r\\nabove it, and came through another smaller door into a sort of veranda propped\\r\\non wooden posts made of single tree-trunks. It faced south and was still warm\\r\\nand filled with the light of the westering sun which slanted into it, and fell\\r\\ngolden on the garden full of flowers that came right up to the steps.\\r\\n\\x0c  Here they sat on wooden benches while Gandalf began his tale, and Bilbo\\r\\nswung his dangling legs and looked at the flowers in the garden, wondering what\\r\\n\\x0ctheir names could be, as he had never seen half of them before.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was coming over the mountains with a friend or two. . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOr two? I can only see one, and a little one at that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell to tell you the truth, I did not like to bother you with a lot of us, until I\\r\\nfound out if you were busy. I will give a call, if I may.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on, call away!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    So Gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently Thorin and Dori came\\r\\nround the house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne or three you meant, I see!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut these aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hobbits, they\\r\\nare dwarves!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThorin Oakenshield, at your service! Dori at your service!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the two\\r\\ndwarves bowing again.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need your service, thank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I expect you need\\r\\nmine. I am not over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are Thorin (son of\\r\\nThrain, son of Thror, I believe), and that your companion is respectable, and that\\r\\nyou are enemies of goblins and are not up to any mischief in my lands\\xe2\\x80\\x94what are\\r\\nyou up to, by the way?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are on their way to visit the land of their fathers, away east beyond\\r\\nMirkwood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d put in Gandalf, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand it is entirely an accident that we are in your\\r\\nlands at all. We were crossing by the High Pass that should have brought us to\\r\\nthe road that lies to the south of your country, when we were attacked by the evil\\r\\ngoblins\\xe2\\x80\\x94as I was about to tell you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on telling, then!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn, who was never very polite.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was a terrible storm; the stone-giants were out hurling rocks, and at\\r\\nthe head of the pass we took refuge in a cave, the hobbit and I and several of our\\r\\ncompanions. . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you call two several?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, no. As a matter of fact there were more than two.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere are they? Killed, eaten, gone home?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, no. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem all to have come when I whistled. Shy, I expect.\\r\\nYou see, we are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on, whistle again! I am in for a party, it seems, and one or two more\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make much difference,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled Beorn.\\r\\n    Gandalf whistled again; but Nori and Ori were there almost before he had\\r\\nstopped, for, if you remember, Gandalf had told them to come in pairs every five\\r\\nminutes.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou came pretty quick\\xe2\\x80\\x94where were you hiding?\\r\\n\\x0cCome on my jack-in-the-boxes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNori at your service, Ori at. . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they began; but Beorn interrupted them.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you! When I want your help I will ask for it. Sit down, and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get\\r\\non with this tale, or it will be supper-time before it is ended.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs soon as we were asleep,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d went on Gandalf, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca crack at the back of the\\r\\ncave opened; goblins came out and grabbed the hobbit and the dwarves and our\\r\\ntroop of ponies\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTroop of ponies? What were you\\xe2\\x80\\x94a travelling circus? Or were you carrying\\r\\nlots of goods? Or do you always call six a troop?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO no! As a matter of fact there were more than six ponies, for there were\\r\\nmore than six of us\\xe2\\x80\\x94and well, here are two more!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Just at that moment Balin\\r\\nand Dwalin appeared and bowed so low that their beards swept the stone floor.\\r\\nThe big man was frowning at first, but they did their best to be frightfully polite,\\r\\nand kept on nodding and bending and bowing and waving their hoods before\\r\\ntheir knees (in proper dwarf-fashion), till he stopped frowning and burst into a\\r\\nchuckling laugh: they looked so comical.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTroop, was right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA fine comic one. Come in my merry men, and\\r\\nwhat are your names? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your service just now, only your names; and\\r\\nthen sit down and stop wagging!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBalin and Dwalin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said not daring to be offended, and sat flop on the\\r\\nfloor looking rather surprised.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow go on again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn to the wizard.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere was I? O yes\\xe2\\x80\\x94I was not grabbed. I killed a goblin or two with a\\r\\nflash\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled Beorn. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is some good being a wizard, then.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x94and slipped inside the crack before it closed. I followed down into the\\r\\nmain hall, which was crowded with goblins. The Great Goblin was there with\\r\\nthirty or forty armed guards. I thought to myself \\xe2\\x80\\x98even if they were not all\\r\\nchained together, what can a dozen do against so many?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA dozen! That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard eight called a dozen. Or have you\\r\\nstill got some more jacks that haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t yet come out of their boxes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, yes, there seem to be a couple more here now\\xe2\\x80\\x94Fili and Kili, I\\r\\nbelieve,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, as these two now appeared and stood smiling and\\r\\nbowing.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSit down and be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    So Gandalf went on with the tale, until he came to the fight in the dark, the\\r\\ndiscovery of the lower gate, and their horror when they found that Mr. Baggins\\r\\n\\x0chad been mislaid. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe counted ourselves and found that there was no hobbit.\\r\\nThere were only fourteen of us left!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFourteen! That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard one from ten leave fourteen. You\\r\\nmean nine, or else you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t told me yet all the names of your party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, of course you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen Oin and Gloin yet. And, bless me! here\\r\\nthey are. I hope you will forgive them for bothering you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO let \\xe2\\x80\\x99em all come! Hurry up! Come along, you two, and sit down! But look\\r\\nhere, Gandalf, even now we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the\\r\\nhobbit that was lost. That only makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not fourteen,\\r\\nunless wizards count differently to other people. But now please get on with the\\r\\ntale.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beorn did not show it more than he could help, but really he had begun to\\r\\nget very interested. You see, in the old days he had known the very part of the\\r\\nmountains that Gandalf was describing. He nodded and he growled, when he\\r\\nheard of the hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reappearance and of their scramble down the stone-slide\\r\\nand of the wolf-ring in the woods.\\r\\n    When Gandalf came to their climbing into trees with the wolves all\\r\\nunderneath, he got up and strode about and muttered: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish I had been there! I\\r\\nwould have given them more than fireworks!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf very glad to see that his tale was making a good\\r\\nimpression, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did the best I could. There we were with the wolves going mad\\r\\nunderneath us and the forest beginning to blaze in places, when the goblins came\\r\\ndown from the hills and discovered us. They yelled with delight and sang songs\\r\\nmaking fun of us. Fifteen birds in five fir-trees . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood heavens!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled Beorn. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pretend that goblins can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count.\\r\\nThey can. Twelve isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fifteen and they know it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so do I. There were Bifur and Bofur as well. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ventured to\\r\\nintroduce them before, but here they are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    In came Bifur and Bofur. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d gasped Bombur puffing up behind. He\\r\\nwas fat, and also angry at being left till last. He refused to wait five minutes, and\\r\\nfollowed immediately after the other two.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, I suppose\\r\\nthat is all that there were up the trees. Now perhaps we can finish this story\\r\\nwithout any more interruptions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Baggins saw then how clever Gandalf had\\r\\nbeen. The interruptions had really made Beorn more interested in the story, and\\r\\nthe story had kept him from sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious\\r\\nbeggars. He never invited people into his house, if he could help it. He had very\\r\\nfew friends and they lived a good way away; and he never invited more than a\\r\\n\\x0ccouple of these to his house at a time. Now he had got fifteen strangers sitting in\\r\\nhis porch!\\r\\n    By the time the wizard had finished his tale and had told of the eagles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rescue\\r\\nand of how they had all been brought to the Carrock, the sun had fallen behind\\r\\nthe peaks of the Misty Mountains and the shadows were long in Beorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s garden.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA very good tale!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe best I have heard for a long while. If all\\r\\nbeggars could tell such a good one, they might find me kinder. You may be\\r\\nmaking it all up, of course, but you deserve a supper for the story all the same.\\r\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have something to eat!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes please!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they all said together. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you very much!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the hall it was now quite dark. Beorn clapped his hands, and in trotted\\r\\nfour beautiful white ponies and several large long-bodied grey dogs. Beorn said\\r\\nsomething to them in a queer language like animal noises turned into talk. They\\r\\nwent out again and soon came back carrying torches in their mouths, which they\\r\\nlit at the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall about the central\\r\\nhearth. The dogs could stand on their hind-legs when they wished, and carry\\r\\nthings with their fore-feet. Quickly they got out boards and trestles from the side\\r\\nwalls and set them up near the fire.\\r\\n     Then baa\\xe2\\x80\\x94baa\\xe2\\x80\\x94baa! was heard, and in came some snow-white sheep led by\\r\\na large coal-black ram. One bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with\\r\\nfigures of animals; others bore on their broad backs trays with bowls and platters\\r\\nand knives and wooden spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on the\\r\\ntrestle-tables. These were very low, low enough even for Bilbo to sit at\\r\\ncomfortably. Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide\\r\\nrush-bottoms and little short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far\\r\\nend he put Beorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s big black chair of the same sort (in which he sat with his\\r\\ngreat legs stuck far out under the table). These were all the chairs he had in his\\r\\nhall, and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the\\r\\nwonderful animals that waited on him. What did the rest sit on? They were not\\r\\nforgotten. The other ponies came in rolling round drum-shaped sections of logs,\\r\\nsmoothed and polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so soon they were all\\r\\nseated at Beorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s table, and the hall had not seen such a gathering for many a\\r\\nyear.\\r\\n     There they had a supper, or a dinner, such as they had not had since they left\\r\\nthe Last Homely House in the West and said good-bye to Elrond. The light of the\\r\\n\\x0ctorches and the fire flickered about them, and on the table were two tall red\\r\\nbeeswax candles. All the time they ate, Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales\\r\\nof the wild lands on this side of the mountains, and especially of the dark and\\r\\ndangerous wood, that lay outstretched far to North and South a day\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ride before\\r\\nthem, barring their way to the East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood.\\r\\n    The dwarves listened and shook their beards, for they knew that they must\\r\\nsoon venture into that forest and that after the mountains it was the worst of the\\r\\nperils they had to pass before they came to the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stronghold. When dinner\\r\\nwas over they began to tell tales of their own, but Beorn seemed to be growing\\r\\ndrowsy and paid little heed to them. They spoke most of gold and silver and\\r\\njewels and the making of things by smith-craft, and Beorn did not appear to care\\r\\nfor such things: there were no things of gold or silver in his hall, and few save\\r\\nthe knives were made of metal at all.\\r\\n    They sat long at the table with their wooden drinking-bowls filled with mead.\\r\\nThe dark night came on outside. The fires in the middle of the hall were built\\r\\nwith fresh logs and the torches were put out, and still they sat in the light of the\\r\\ndancing flames with the pillars of the house standing tall behind them, and dark\\r\\nat the top like trees of the forest. Whether it was magic or not, it seemed to Bilbo\\r\\nthat he heard a sound like wind in the branches stirring in the rafters, and the\\r\\nhoot of owls. Soon he began to nod with sleep and the voices seemed to grow far\\r\\naway, until he woke with a start.\\r\\n    The great door had creaked and slammed. Beorn was gone. The dwarves\\r\\nwere sitting cross-legged on the floor round the fire, and presently they began to\\r\\nsing. Some of the verses were like this, but there were many more, and their\\r\\nsinging went on for a long while:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The wind was on the withered heath,\\r\\n       but in the forest stirred no leaf:\\r\\n       there shadows lay by night and day,\\r\\n       and dark things silent crept beneath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The wind came down from mountains cold,\\r\\n       and like a tide it roared and rolled;\\r\\n       the branches groaned, the forest moaned,\\r\\n       and leaves were laid upon the mould.\\r\\n\\x0c       The wind went on from West to East;\\r\\n       all movement in the forest ceased,\\r\\n       but shrill and harsh across the marsh\\r\\n       its whistling voices were released.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The grasses hissed, their tassels bent,\\r\\n       the reeds were rattling\\xe2\\x80\\x94on it went\\r\\n       o\\xe2\\x80\\x99er shaken pool under heavens cool\\r\\n       where racing clouds were torn and rent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       It passed the lonely Mountain bare\\r\\n       and swept above the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lair:\\r\\n       there black and dark lay boulders stark\\r\\n       and flying smoke was in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       It left the world and took its flight\\r\\n       over the wide seas of the night.\\r\\n       The moon set sail upon the gale,\\r\\n       and stars were fanned to leaping light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    Bilbo began to nod again. Suddenly up stood Gandalf.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is time for us to sleep,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x94for us, but not I think for Beorn. In\\r\\nthis hall we can rest sound and safe, but I warn you all not to forget what Beorn\\r\\nsaid before he left us: you must not stray outside until the sun is up, on your\\r\\nperil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of\\r\\nraised platform between the pillars and the outer wall. For him there was a little\\r\\nmattress of straw and woollen blankets. He snuggled into them very gladly,\\r\\nsummertime though it was. The fire burned low and he fell asleep. Yet in the\\r\\nnight he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and Gandalf\\r\\nwere all asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of white on the floor came\\r\\nfrom the high moon, which was peering down through the smoke-hole in the\\r\\nroof.\\r\\n    There was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal\\r\\n\\x0cscuffling at the door. Bilbo wondered what it was, and whether it could be Beorn\\r\\nin enchanted shape, and if he would come in as a bear and kill them. He dived\\r\\nunder the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last in spite of his\\r\\nfears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was full morning when he awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over him in\\r\\nthe shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform\\r\\non to the floor. It was Bofur, and he was grumbling about it, when Bilbo opened\\r\\nhis eyes.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet up lazybones,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor there will be no breakfast left for you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Up jumped Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBreakfast!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is breakfast?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMostly inside us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered the other dwarves who were moving about the\\r\\nhall; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut what is left is out on the veranda. We have been about looking for\\r\\nBeorn ever since the sun got up; but there is no sign of him anywhere, though we\\r\\nfound breakfast laid as soon as we went out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is Gandalf?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as\\r\\nquick as he could.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO! out and about somewhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they told him. But he saw no sign of the\\r\\nwizard all that day until the evening. Just before sunset he walked into the hall,\\r\\nwhere the hobbit and the dwarves were having supper, waited on by Beorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nwonderful animals, as they had been all day. Of Beorn they had seen and heard\\r\\nnothing since the night before, and they were getting puzzled.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is our host, and where have you been all day yourself?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they all\\r\\ncried.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne question at a time\\xe2\\x80\\x94and none till after supper! I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had a bite since\\r\\nbreakfast.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    At last Gandalf pushed away his plate and jug\\xe2\\x80\\x94he had eaten two whole\\r\\nloaves (with masses of butter and honey and clotted cream) and drunk at least a\\r\\nquart of mead\\xe2\\x80\\x94and he took out his pipe. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will answer the second question\\r\\nfirst,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x94but bless me! this is a splendid place for smoke rings!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Indeed\\r\\nfor a long time they could get nothing more out of him, he was so busy sending\\r\\nsmoke rings dodging round the pillars of the hall, changing them into all sorts of\\r\\ndifferent shapes and colours, and setting them at last chasing one another out of\\r\\nthe hole in the roof. They must have looked very queer from outside, popping\\r\\nout into the air one after another, green, blue, red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big\\r\\nones, little ones; little ones dodging through big ones and joining into figure-\\r\\n\\x0ceights, and going off like a flock of birds into the distance.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been picking out bear-tracks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere must have been\\r\\na regular bears\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meeting outside here last night. I soon saw that Beorn could not\\r\\nhave made them all: there were far too many of them, and they were of various\\r\\nsizes too. I should say there were little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and\\r\\ngigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn. They came\\r\\nfrom almost every direction, except from the west over the river, from the\\r\\nMountains. In that direction only one set of footprints led\\xe2\\x80\\x94none coming, only\\r\\nones going away from here. I followed these as far as the Carrock. There they\\r\\ndisappeared into the river, but the water was too deep and strong beyond the rock\\r\\nfor me to cross. It is easy enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the\\r\\nCarrock by the ford, but on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling\\r\\nchannel. I had to walk miles before I found a place where the river was wide and\\r\\nshallow enough for me to wade and swim, and then miles back again to pick up\\r\\nthe tracks again. By that time it was too late for me to follow them far. They\\r\\nwent straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the Misty\\r\\nMountains, where we had our pleasant little party with the Wargs the night\\r\\nbefore last. And now I think I have answered your first question, too,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ended\\r\\nGandalf, and he sat a long while silent.\\r\\n    Bilbo thought he knew what the wizard meant. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat shall we do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cif he leads all the Wargs and the goblins down here? We shall all be caught and\\r\\nkilled! I thought you said he was not a friend of theirs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I did. And don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be silly! You had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did\\r\\ngo to bed; and while the dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep, still\\r\\npuzzling his little head about Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of\\r\\nblack bears dancing slow heavy dances round and round in the moonlight in the\\r\\ncourtyard. Then he woke up when everyone else was asleep, and he heard the\\r\\nsame scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and growling as before.\\r\\n    Next morning they were all wakened by Beorn himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo here you all are\\r\\nstill!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. He picked up the hobbit and laughed: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot eaten up by Wargs or\\r\\ngoblins or wicked bears yet I see\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and he poked Mr. Baggins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 waistcoat most\\r\\ndisrespectfully. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLittle bunny is getting nice and fat again on bread and honey,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe chuckled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome and have some more!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    So they all went to breakfast with him. Beorn was most jolly for a change;\\r\\nindeed he seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and set them all laughing\\r\\nwith his funny stories; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or\\r\\n\\x0cwhy he was so nice to them, for he told them himself. He had been over the river\\r\\nand right back up into the mountains\\xe2\\x80\\x94from which you can guess that he could\\r\\ntravel quickly, in bear\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shape at any rate. From the burnt wolf-glade he had soon\\r\\nfound out that part of their story was true; but he had found more than that: he\\r\\nhad caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the woods. From these he had got\\r\\nnews: the goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for the dwarves, and they\\r\\nwere fiercely angry because of the death of the Great Goblin, and also because\\r\\nof the burning of the chief wolf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nose and the death from the wizard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fire of\\r\\nmany of his chief servants. So much they told him when he forced them, but he\\r\\nguessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and that a great raid of the\\r\\nwhole goblin army with their wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the\\r\\nmountains might soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the\\r\\nmen and creatures that lived there, and who they thought must be sheltering\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a good story, that of yours,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I like it still better now I\\r\\nam sure it is true. You must forgive my not taking your word. If you lived near\\r\\nthe edge of Mirkwood, you would take the word of no one that you did not know\\r\\nas well as your brother or better. As it is, I can only say that I have hurried home\\r\\nas fast as I could to see that you were safe, and to offer you any help that I can. I\\r\\nshall think more kindly of dwarves after this. Killed the Great Goblin, killed the\\r\\nGreat Goblin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he chuckled fiercely to himself.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did you do with the goblin and the Warg?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo suddenly.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome and see!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Beorn, and they followed round the house. A goblin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nhead was stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond.\\r\\nBeorn was a fierce enemy. But now he was their friend, and Gandalf thought it\\r\\nwise to tell him their whole story and the reason of their journey, so that they\\r\\ncould get the most help he could offer.\\r\\n     This is what he promised to do for them. He would provide ponies for each of\\r\\nthem, and a horse for Gandalf, for their journey to the forest, and he would lade\\r\\nthem with food to last them for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as easy\\r\\nas possible to carry\\xe2\\x80\\x94nuts, flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware\\r\\npots of honey, and twice-baked cakes that would keep good a long time, and on a\\r\\nlittle of which they could march far. The making of these was one of his secrets;\\r\\nbut honey was in them, as in most of his foods, and they were good to eat,\\r\\nthough they made one thirsty. Water, he said, they would not need to carry this\\r\\nside of the forest, for there were streams and springs along the road. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut your\\r\\nway through Mirkwood is dark, dangerous and difficult,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWater is not\\r\\n\\x0ceasy to find there, nor food. The time is not yet come for nuts (though it may be\\r\\npast and gone indeed before you get to the other side), and nuts are about all that\\r\\ngrows there fit for food; in there the wild things are dark, queer, and savage. I\\r\\nwill provide you with skins for carrying water, and I will give you some bows\\r\\nand arrows. But I doubt very much whether anything you find in Mirkwood will\\r\\nbe wholesome to eat or to drink. There is one stream there, I know, black and\\r\\nstrong which crosses the path. That you should neither drink of, nor bathe in; for\\r\\nI have heard that it carries enchantment and a great drowsiness and forgetfulness.\\r\\nAnd in the dim shadows of that place I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think you will shoot anything,\\r\\nwholesome or unwholesome, without straying from the path. That you MUST\\r\\nNOT do, for any reason.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is all the advice I can give you. Beyond the edge of the forest I cannot\\r\\nhelp you much; you must depend on your luck and your courage and the food I\\r\\nsend with you. At the gate of the forest I must ask you to send back my horse\\r\\nand my ponies. But I wish you all speed, and my house is open to you, if ever\\r\\nyou come back this way again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey thanked him, of course, with many bows and sweepings of their hoods and\\r\\nwith many an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat your service, O master of the wide wooden halls!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But their\\r\\nspirits sank at his grave words, and they all felt that the adventure was far more\\r\\ndangerous than they had thought, while all the time, even if they passed all the\\r\\nperils of the road, the dragon was waiting at the end.\\r\\n    All that morning they were busy with preparations. Soon after midday they\\r\\nate with Beorn for the last time, and after the meal they mounted the steeds he\\r\\nwas lending them, and bidding him many farewells they rode off through his\\r\\ngate at a good pace.\\r\\n    As soon as they left his high hedges at the east of his fenced lands they turned\\r\\nnorth and then bore to the north-west. By his advice they were no longer making\\r\\nfor the main forest-road to the south of his land. Had they followed the pass,\\r\\ntheir path would have led them down a stream from the mountains that joined\\r\\nthe great river miles south of the Carrock. At that point there was a deep ford\\r\\nwhich they might have passed, if they had still had their ponies, and beyond that\\r\\na track led to the skirts of the wood and to the entrance of the old forest road.\\r\\nBut Beorn had warned them that that way was now often used by the goblins,\\r\\nwhile the forest-road itself, he had heard, was overgrown and disused at the\\r\\neastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long been lost.\\r\\n\\x0cIts eastern opening had also always been far to the south of the Lonely\\r\\nMountain, and would have left them still with a long and difficult northward\\r\\nmarch when they got to the other side. North of the Carrock the edge of\\r\\nMirkwood drew closer to the borders of the Great River, and though here the\\r\\nMountains too drew down nearer, Beorn advised them to take this way; for at a\\r\\nplace a few days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ride due north of the Carrock was the gate of a little-known\\r\\npathway through Mirkwood that led almost straight towards the Lonely\\r\\nMountain.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe goblins,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Beorn had said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill not dare to cross the Great River for a\\r\\nhundred miles north of the Carrock nor to come near my house\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is well\\r\\nprotected at night!\\xe2\\x80\\x94but I should ride fast; for if they make their raid soon they\\r\\nwill cross the river to the south and scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut\\r\\nyou off, and Wargs run swifter than ponies. Still you are safer going north, even\\r\\nthough you seem to be going back nearer to their strongholds; for that is what\\r\\nthey will least expect, and they will have the longer ride to catch you. Be off\\r\\nnow as quick as you may!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    That is why they were now riding in silence, galloping wherever the ground\\r\\nwas grassy and smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, and in the distance\\r\\nthe line of the river with its trees drawing ever closer. The sun had only just\\r\\nturned west when they started, and till evening it lay golden on the land about\\r\\nthem. It was difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and when they had put\\r\\nmany miles between them and Beorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house they began to talk and to sing\\r\\nagain and to forget the dark forest-path that lay in front. But in the evening when\\r\\nthe dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains glowered against the sunset\\r\\nthey made a camp and set a guard, and most of them slept uneasily with dreams\\r\\nin which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins.\\r\\n    Still the next morning dawned bright and fair again. There was an autumn-\\r\\nlike mist white upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon the sun rose red\\r\\nin the East and the mists vanished, and while the shadows were still long they\\r\\nwere off again. So they rode now for two more days, and all the while they saw\\r\\nnothing save grass and flowers and birds and scattered trees, and occasionally\\r\\nsmall herds of red deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. Sometimes\\r\\nBilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he\\r\\nthought they were the dead branches of trees. That third evening they were so\\r\\neager to press on, for Beorn had said that they should reach the forest-gate early\\r\\non the fourth-day, that they rode still forward after dusk and into the night\\r\\nbeneath the moon. As the light faded Bilbo thought he saw away to the right, or\\r\\n\\x0cto the left, the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along in the same\\r\\ndirection. But if he dared to mention it to Gandalf, the wizard only said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHush!\\r\\nTake no notice!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Next day they started before dawn, though their night had been short. As\\r\\nsoon as it was light they could see the forest coming as it were to meet them, or\\r\\nwaiting for them like a black and frowning wall before them. The land began to\\r\\nslope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit that a silence began to draw in upon\\r\\nthem. Birds began to sing less. There were no more deer; not even rabbits were\\r\\nto be seen. By the afternoon they had reached the eaves of Mirkwood, and were\\r\\nresting almost beneath the great overhanging boughs of its outer trees. Their\\r\\ntrunks were huge and gnarled, their branches twisted, their leaves were dark and\\r\\nlong. Ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, here is Mirkwood!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe greatest of the forests of the\\r\\nNorthern world. I hope you like the look of it. Now you must send back these\\r\\nexcellent ponies you have borrowed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The dwarves were inclined to grumble at this, but the wizard told them they\\r\\nwere fools. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeorn is not as far off as you seem to think, and you had better keep\\r\\nyour promises anyway, for he is a bad enemy. Mr. Baggins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 eyes are sharper than\\r\\nyours, if you have not seen each night after dark a great bear going along with us\\r\\nor sitting far off in the moon watching our camps. Not only to guard you and\\r\\nguide you, but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn may be your friend, but\\r\\nhe loves his animals as his children. You do not guess what kindness he has\\r\\nshown you in letting dwarves ride them so far and so fast, nor what would\\r\\nhappen to you, if you tried to take them into the forest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about the horse, then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention sending that\\r\\nback.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, because I am not sending it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about your promise then?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will look after that. I am not sending the horse back, I am riding it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then they knew that Gandalf was going to leave them at the very edge of\\r\\nMirkwood, and they were in despair. But nothing they could say would change\\r\\nhis mind.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we had this all out before, when we landed on the Carrock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is no use arguing. I have, as I told you, some pressing business away south;\\r\\nand I am already late through bothering with you people. We may meet again\\r\\nbefore all is over, and then again of course we may not. That depends on your\\r\\nluck and on your courage and sense; and I am sending Mr. Baggins with you. I\\r\\n\\x0chave told you before that he has more about him than you guess, and you will\\r\\nfind that out before long. So cheer up Bilbo and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look so glum. Cheer up\\r\\nThorin and Company! This is your expedition after all. Think of the treasure at\\r\\nthe end, and forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until tomorrow\\r\\nmorning!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    When tomorrow morning came he still said the same. So now there was\\r\\nnothing left to do but to fill their water-skins at a clear spring they found close to\\r\\nthe forest-gate, and unpack the ponies. They distributed the packages as fairly as\\r\\nthey could, though Bilbo thought his lot was wearisomely heavy, and did not at\\r\\nall like the idea of trudging for miles and miles with all that on his back.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you worry!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will get lighter all too soon. Before long\\r\\nI expect we shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food begins to run short.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then at last they said good-bye to their ponies and turned their heads for\\r\\nhome. Off they trotted gaily, seeming very glad to put their tails towards the\\r\\nshadow of Mirkwood. As they went away Bilbo could have sworn that a thing\\r\\nlike a bear left the shadow of the trees and shambled off quickly after them.\\r\\n    Now Gandalf too said farewell. Bilbo sat on the ground feeling very unhappy\\r\\nand wishing he was beside the wizard on his tall horse. He had gone just inside\\r\\nthe forest after breakfast (a very poor one), and it had seemed as dark in there in\\r\\nthe morning as at night, and very secret: \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca sort of watching and waiting\\r\\nfeeling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to himself.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-bye!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf to Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd goodbye to you all, good-bye!\\r\\nStraight through the forest is your way now. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stray off the track!\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you\\r\\ndo, it is a thousand to one you will never find it again and never get out of\\r\\nMirkwood; and then I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose I, or any one else, will ever see you again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo we really have to go through?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d groaned the hobbit.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, you do!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you want to get to the other side. You\\r\\nmust either go through or give up your quest. And I am not going to allow you to\\r\\nback out now, Mr. Baggins. I am ashamed of you for thinking of it. You have got\\r\\nto look after all these dwarves for me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he laughed.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo! no!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean that. I meant, is there no way round?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north,\\r\\nand twice that south. But you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a safe path even then. There are no\\r\\nsafe paths in this part of the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild\\r\\nnow, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go. Before you could get round\\r\\nMirkwood in the North you would be right among the slopes of the Grey\\r\\nMountains, and they are simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs of the\\r\\n\\x0cworst description. Before you could get round it in the South, you would get into\\r\\nthe land of the Necromancer; and even you, Bilbo, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need me to tell you\\r\\ntales of that black sorcerer. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t advise you to go anywhere near the places\\r\\noverlooked by his dark tower! Stick to the forest-track, keep your spirits up,\\r\\nhope for the best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day\\r\\nand see the Long Marshes lying below you, and beyond them, high in the East,\\r\\nthe Lonely Mountain where dear old Smaug lives, though I hope he is not\\r\\nexpecting you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery comforting you are to be sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-bye! If you\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come with us, you had better get off without any more talk!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-bye then, and really good-bye!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf, and he turned his horse\\r\\nand rode down into the West. But he could not resist the temptation to have the\\r\\nlast word. Before he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands\\r\\nto his mouth and called to them. They heard his voice come faintly: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-bye!\\r\\nBe good, take care of yourselves\\xe2\\x80\\x94and DON\\xe2\\x80\\x99T LEAVE THE PATH!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO good-bye and go\\r\\naway!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grunted the dwarves, all the more angry because they were really filled\\r\\nwith dismay at losing him. Now began the most dangerous part of all the\\r\\njourney. They each shouldered the heavy pack and the water-skin which was\\r\\ntheir share, and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged\\r\\ninto the forest.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter VIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFLIES AND SPIDERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked in single file. The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch\\r\\nleading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together, too old\\r\\nand strangled with ivy and hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened\\r\\nleaves. The path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the trunks. Soon\\r\\nthe light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind, and the quiet was so\\r\\ndeep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them\\r\\nand listened.\\r\\n    As their eyes became used to the dimness they could see a little way to either\\r\\nside in a sort of darkened green glimmer. Occasionally a slender beam of sun\\r\\nthat had the luck to slip in through some opening in the leaves far above, and\\r\\nstill more luck in not being caught in the tangled boughs and matted twigs\\r\\nbeneath, stabbed down thin and bright before them. But this was seldom, and it\\r\\nsoon ceased altogether.\\r\\n    There were black squirrels in the wood. As Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sharp inquisitive eyes got\\r\\nused to seeing things he could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path and\\r\\nscuttling behind tree-trunks. There were queer noises too, grunts, scufflings, and\\r\\nhurryings in the undergrowth, and among the leaves that lay piled endlessly thick\\r\\nin places on the forest-floor; but what made the noises he could not see. The\\r\\nnastiest things they saw were the cobwebs: dark dense cobwebs with threads\\r\\nextraordinarily thick, often stretched from tree to tree, or tangled in the lower\\r\\nbranches on either side of them. There were none stretched across the path, but\\r\\nwhether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason they could\\r\\nnot guess.\\r\\n    It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had\\r\\nhated the tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any\\r\\n\\x0cending. But they had to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of the\\r\\nsun and of the sky, and longed for the feel of wind on their faces. There was no\\r\\nmovement of air down under the forest-roof, and it was everlastingly still and\\r\\ndark and stuffy. Even the dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and lived\\r\\nat times for long whiles without the light of the sun; but the hobbit, who liked\\r\\nholes to make a house in but not to spend summer days in, felt that he was being\\r\\nslowly suffocated.\\r\\n    The nights were the worst. It then became pitch-dark\\xe2\\x80\\x94not what you call\\r\\npitch-dark, but really pitch: so black that you really could see nothing. Bilbo\\r\\ntried flapping his hand in front of his nose, but he could not see it at all. Well,\\r\\nperhaps it is not true to say that they could see nothing: they could see eyes.\\r\\nThey slept all closely huddled together, and took it in turns to watch; and when it\\r\\nwas Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turn he would see gleams in the darkness round them, and\\r\\nsometimes pairs of yellow or red or green eyes would stare at him from a little\\r\\ndistance, and then slowly fade and disappear and slowly shine out again in\\r\\nanother place. And sometimes they would gleam down from the branches just\\r\\nabove him; and that was most terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least were\\r\\nhorrible pale bulbous sort of eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInsect eyes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot animal eyes,\\r\\nonly they are much too big.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Although it was not yet very cold, they tried lighting watch-fires at night, but\\r\\nthey soon gave that up. It seemed to bring hundreds and hundreds of eyes all\\r\\nround them, though the creatures, whatever they were, were careful never to let\\r\\ntheir bodies show in the little flicker of the flames. Worse still it brought\\r\\nthousands of dark-grey and black moths, some nearly as big as your hand,\\r\\nflapping and whirring round their ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge\\r\\nbats, black as a top-hat, either; so they gave up fires and sat at night and dozed in\\r\\nthe enormous uncanny darkness.\\r\\n    All this went on for what seemed to the hobbit ages upon ages; and he was\\r\\nalways hungry, for they were extremely careful with their provisions. Even so, as\\r\\ndays followed days, and still the forest seemed just the same, they began to get\\r\\nanxious. The food would not last for ever: it was in fact already beginning to get\\r\\nlow. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and they wasted many arrows before\\r\\nthey managed to bring one down on the path. But when they roasted it, it proved\\r\\nhorrible to taste, and they shot no more squirrels.\\r\\n    They were thirsty too, for they had none too much water, and in all the time\\r\\nthey had seen neither spring nor stream. This was their state when one day they\\r\\nfound their path blocked by a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not\\r\\n\\x0cvery wide right across the way, and it was black, or looked it in the gloom. It was\\r\\nwell that Beorn had warned them against it, or they would have drunk from it,\\r\\nwhatever its colour, and filled some of their emptied skins at its bank. As it was\\r\\nthey only thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves in its water.\\r\\nThere had been a bridge of wood across, but it had rotted and fallen leaving only\\r\\nthe broken posts near the bank.\\r\\n    Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a boat\\r\\nagainst the far bank! Now why couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it have been this side!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow far away do you think it is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Thorin, for by now they knew\\r\\nBilbo had the sharpest eyes among them.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at all far. I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think above twelve yards.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwelve yards! I should have thought it was thirty at least, but my eyes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsee as well as they used a hundred years ago. Still twelve yards is as good as a\\r\\nmile. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t jump it, and we daren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t try to wade or swim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan any of you throw a rope?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the good of that? The boat is sure to be tied up, even if we could\\r\\nhook it, which I doubt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it is tied,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthough of course I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be sure in this\\r\\nlight; but it looks to me as if it was just drawn up on the bank, which is low just\\r\\nthere where the path goes down into the water.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDori is the strongest, but Fili is the youngest and still has the best sight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome here Fili, and see if you can see the boat Mr. Baggins is\\r\\ntalking about.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Fili thought he could; so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the\\r\\ndirection, the others brought him a rope. They had several with them, and on the\\r\\nend of the longest they fastened one of the large iron hooks they had used for\\r\\ncatching their packs to the straps about their shoulders. Fili took this in his hand,\\r\\nbalanced it for a moment, and then flung it across the stream.\\r\\n    Splash it fell in the water! \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot far enough!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo who was peering\\r\\nforward. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA couple of feet and you would have dropped it on to the boat. Try\\r\\nagain. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose the magic is strong enough to hurt you, if you just touch a\\r\\nbit of wet rope.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Fili picked up the hook when he had drawn it back, rather doubtfully all the\\r\\nsame. This time he threw it with great strength.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSteady!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou have thrown it right into the wood on the other\\r\\nside now. Draw it back gently.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fili hauled the rope back slowly, and after a\\r\\nwhile Bilbo said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCarefully! It is lying on the boat; let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hope the hook will\\r\\n\\x0ccatch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     It did. The rope went taut, and Fili pulled in vain. Kili came to his help, and\\r\\nthen Oin and Gloin. They tugged and tugged, and suddenly they all fell over on\\r\\ntheir backs. Bilbo was on the look out, however, caught the rope, and with a\\r\\npiece of stick fended off the little black boat as it came rushing across the\\r\\nstream. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHelp!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted, and Balin was just in time to seize the boat before it\\r\\nfloated off down the current.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was tied after all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, looking at the snapped painter that was still\\r\\ndangling from it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was a good pull, my lads; and a good job that our rope\\r\\nwas the stronger.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll cross first?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand you will come with me, and Fili and Balin. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nas many as the boat will hold at a time. After that Kili and Oin and Gloin and\\r\\nDori; next Ori and Nori, Bifur and Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m always last and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bombur. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s somebody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turn\\r\\ntoday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou should not be so fat. As you are, you must be with the last and lightest\\r\\nboatload. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start grumbling against orders, or something bad will happen to\\r\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any oars. How are you going to push the boat back to the far\\r\\nbank?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the hobbit.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGive me another length of rope and another hook,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fili, and when they\\r\\nhad got it ready, he cast it into the darkness ahead and as high as he could throw\\r\\nit. Since it did not fall down again, they saw that it must have stuck in the\\r\\nbranches. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet in now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fili, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand one of you haul on the rope that is stuck\\r\\nin a tree on the other side. One of the others must keep hold of the hook we used\\r\\nat first, and when we are safe on the other side he can hook it on, and you can\\r\\ndraw the boat back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     In this way they were all soon on the far bank safe across the enchanted\\r\\nstream. Dwalin had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on his arm, and\\r\\nBombur (still grumbling) was getting ready to follow, when something bad did\\r\\nhappen. There was a flying sound of hooves on the path ahead. Out of the gloom\\r\\ncame suddenly the shape of a flying deer. It charged into the dwarves and\\r\\nbowled them over, then gathered itself for a leap. High it sprang and cleared the\\r\\nwater with a mighty jump. But it did not reach the other side in safety. Thorin\\r\\nwas the only one who had kept his feet and his wits. As soon as they had landed\\r\\nhe had bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat\\r\\n\\x0cappeared. Now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. As it reached\\r\\nthe further bank it stumbled. The shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the\\r\\nsound of hooves quickly falter and then go still.\\r\\n     Before they could shout in praise of the shot, however, a dreadful wail from\\r\\nBilbo put all thoughts of venison out of their minds. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBombur has fallen in!\\r\\nBombur is drowning!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. It was only too true. Bombur had only one foot\\r\\non the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He had\\r\\nstumbled, thrusting the boat away from the bank, and then toppled back into the\\r\\ndark water, his hands slipping off the slimy roots at the edge, while the boat span\\r\\nslowly off and disappeared.\\r\\n     They could still see his hood above the water when they ran to the bank.\\r\\nQuickly, they flung a rope with a hook towards him. His hand caught it, and they\\r\\npulled him to the shore. He was drenched from hair to boots, of course, but that\\r\\nwas not the worst. When they laid him on the bank he was already fast asleep,\\r\\nwith one hand clutching the rope so tight that they could not get it from his\\r\\ngrasp; and fast asleep he remained in spite of all they could do.\\r\\n     They were still standing over him, cursing their ill luck, and Bombur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nclumsiness, and lamenting the loss of the boat which made it impossible for\\r\\nthem to go back and look for the hart, when they became aware of the dim\\r\\nblowing of horns in the wood and the sound as of dogs baying far off. Then they\\r\\nall fell silent; and as they sat it seemed they could hear the noise of a great hunt\\r\\ngoing by to the north of the path, though they saw no sign of it.\\r\\n     There they sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move. Bombur\\r\\nslept on with a smile on his fat face, as if he no longer cared for all the troubles\\r\\nthat vexed them. Suddenly on the path ahead appeared some white deer, a hind\\r\\nand fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark. They glimmered in the\\r\\nshadows. Before Thorin could cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to their\\r\\nfeet and loosed off arrows from their bows. None seemed to find their mark. The\\r\\ndeer turned and vanished in the trees as silently as they had come, and in vain\\r\\nthe dwarves shot their arrows after them.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStop! stop!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Thorin; but it was too late, the excited dwarves had\\r\\nwasted their last arrows, and now the bows that Beorn had given them were\\r\\nuseless.\\r\\n     They were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper on\\r\\nthem in the following days. They had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond\\r\\nit the path seemed to straggle on just as before, and in the forest they could see\\r\\nno change. Yet if they had known more about it and considered the meaning of\\r\\n\\x0cthe hunt and the white deer that had appeared upon their path, they would have\\r\\nknown that they were at last drawing towards the eastern edge, and would soon\\r\\nhave come, if they could have kept up their courage and their hope, to thinner\\r\\ntrees and places where the sunlight came again.\\r\\n    But they did not know this, and they were burdened with the heavy body of\\r\\nBombur, which they had to carry along with them as best they could, taking the\\r\\nwearisome task in turns of four each while the others shared their packs. If these\\r\\nhad not become all too light in the last few days, they would never have\\r\\nmanaged it; but a slumbering and smiling Bombur was a poor exchange for\\r\\npacks filled with food however heavy. In a few days a time came when there was\\r\\npractically nothing left to eat or to drink. Nothing wholesome could they see\\r\\ngrowing in the wood, only funguses and herbs with pale leaves and unpleasant\\r\\nsmell.\\r\\n    About four days from the enchanted stream they came to a part where most\\r\\nof the trees were beeches. They were at first inclined to be cheered by the\\r\\nchange, for here there was no undergrowth and the shadow was not so deep.\\r\\nThere was a greenish light about them, and in places they could see some\\r\\ndistance to either side of the path. Yet the light only showed them endless lines\\r\\nof straight grey trunks like the pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a\\r\\nbreath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a sad sound. A few leaves came\\r\\nrustling down to remind them that outside autumn was coming on. Their feet\\r\\nruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the\\r\\nbanks of the path from the deep red carpets of the forest.\\r\\n    Still Bombur slept and they grew very weary. At times they heard disquieting\\r\\nlaughter. Sometimes there was singing in the distance too. The laughter was the\\r\\nlaughter of fair voices not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but it\\r\\nsounded eerie and strange, and they were not comforted, rather they hurried on\\r\\nfrom those parts with what strength they had left.\\r\\n    Two days later they found their path going downwards, and before long they\\r\\nwere in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs there no end to this accursed forest?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomebody must climb\\r\\na tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and have a look round. The\\r\\nonly way is to choose the tallest tree that overhangs the path.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Of course \\xe2\\x80\\x9csomebody\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meant Bilbo. They chose him, because to be of any\\r\\nuse the climber must get his head above the topmost leaves, and so he must be\\r\\nlight enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him. Poor Mr.\\r\\nBaggins had never had much practice in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up\\r\\n\\x0cinto the lowest branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path,\\r\\nand up he had to go as best he could. He pushed his way through the tangled\\r\\ntwigs with many a slap in the eye; he was greened and grimed from the old bark\\r\\nof the greater boughs; more than once he slipped and caught himself just in time;\\r\\nand at last, after a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where there seemed to be\\r\\nno convenient branches at all, he got near the top. All the time he was wondering\\r\\nwhether there were spiders in the tree, and how he was going to get down again\\r\\n(except by falling).\\r\\n    In the end he poked his head above the roof of leaves, and then he found\\r\\nspiders all right. But they were only small ones of ordinary size, and they were\\r\\nafter the butterflies. Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes were nearly blinded by the light. He could hear\\r\\nthe dwarves shouting up at him from far below, but he could not answer, only\\r\\nhold on and blink. The sun was shining brilliantly, and it was a long while before\\r\\nhe could bear it. When he could, he saw all round him a sea of dark green,\\r\\nruffled here and there by the breeze; and there were everywhere hundreds of\\r\\nbutterflies. I expect they were a kind of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurple emperor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a butterfly that loves\\r\\nthe tops of oak-woods, but these were not purple at all, they were a dark dark\\r\\nvelvety black without any markings to be seen.\\r\\n    He looked at the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack emperors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for a long time, and enjoyed the feel of the\\r\\nbreeze in his hair and on his face; but at length the cries of the dwarves, who\\r\\nwere now simply stamping with impatience down below, reminded him of his\\r\\nreal business. It was no good. Gaze as much as he might, he could see no end to\\r\\nthe trees and the leaves in any direction. His heart, that had been lightened by the\\r\\nsight of the sun and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: there was no\\r\\nfood to go back to down below.\\r\\n    Actually, as I have told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest; and\\r\\nif Bilbo had had the sense to see it, the tree that he had climbed, though it was\\r\\ntall in itself, was standing near the bottom of a wide valley, so that from its top\\r\\nthe trees seemed to swell up all round like the edges of a great bowl, and he\\r\\ncould not expect to see how far the forest lasted. Still he did not see this, and he\\r\\nclimbed down full of despair. He got to the bottom again at last, scratched, hot,\\r\\nand miserable, and he could not see anything in the gloom below when he got\\r\\nthere. His report soon made the others as miserable as he was.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions! Whatever\\r\\nshall we do? And what is the use of sending a hobbit!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried, as if it was his\\r\\nfault. They did not care tuppence about the butterflies, and were only made more\\r\\nangry when he told them of the beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to\\r\\n\\x0cclimb up and feel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night they ate their very last scraps and crumbs of food; and next morning\\r\\nwhen they woke the first thing they noticed was that they were still gnawingly\\r\\nhungry, and the next thing was that it was raining and that here and there the drip\\r\\nof it was dropping heavily on the forest floor. That only reminded them that they\\r\\nwere also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to relieve them: you cannot\\r\\nquench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a chance\\r\\ndrip to fall on your tongue. The only scrap of comfort there was came\\r\\nunexpectedly from Bombur.\\r\\n    He woke up suddenly and sat up scratching his head. He could not make out\\r\\nwhere he was at all, nor why he felt so hungry; for he had forgotten everything\\r\\nthat had happened since they started their journey that May morning long ago.\\r\\nThe last thing that he remembered was the party at the hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house, and they\\r\\nhad great difficulty in making him believe their tale of all the many adventures\\r\\nthey had had since.\\r\\n    When he heard that there was nothing to eat, he sat down and wept, for he\\r\\nfelt very weak and wobbly in the legs. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy ever did I wake up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwas having such beautiful dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a forest rather\\r\\nlike this one, only lit with torches on the trees and lamps swinging from the\\r\\nbranches and fires burning on the ground; and there was a great feast going on,\\r\\ngoing on for ever. A woodland king was there with a crown of leaves, and there\\r\\nwas a merry singing, and I could not count or describe the things there were to\\r\\neat and drink.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou need not try,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn fact if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about something\\r\\nelse, you had better be silent. We are quite annoyed enough with you as it is. If\\r\\nyou hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t waked up, we should have left you to your idiotic dreams in the\\r\\nforest; you are no joke to carry even after weeks of short commons.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    There was nothing now to be done but to tighten the belts round their empty\\r\\nstomachs, and hoist their empty sacks and packs, and trudge along the track\\r\\nwithout any great hope of ever getting to the end before they lay down and died\\r\\nof starvation. This they did all that day, going very slowly and wearily; while\\r\\nBombur kept on wailing that his legs would not carry him and that he wanted to\\r\\nlie down and sleep.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet your legs take their share, we have carried\\r\\nyou far enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    All the same he suddenly refused to go a step further and flung himself on the\\r\\nground. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on, if you must,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just going to lie here and sleep and\\r\\ndream of food, if I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it any other way. I hope I never wake up again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    At that very moment Balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\r\\nwas that? I thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    They all looked, and a longish way off, it seemed, they saw a red twinkle in\\r\\nthe dark; then another and another sprang out beside it. Even Bombur got up,\\r\\nand they hurried along then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. The light was\\r\\nin front of them and to the left of the path, and when at last they had drawn level\\r\\nwith it, it seemed plain that torches and fires were burning under the trees, but a\\r\\ngood way off their track.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt looks as if my dreams were coming true,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d gasped Bombur puffing up\\r\\nbehind. He wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. But the\\r\\nothers remembered only too well the warnings of the wizard and of Beorn.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA feast would be no good, if we never got back alive from it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut without a feast we shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t remain alive much longer anyway,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nBombur, and Bilbo heartily agreed with him. They argued about it backwards\\r\\nand forwards for a long while, until they agreed at length to send out a couple of\\r\\nspies, to creep near the lights and find out more about them. But then they could\\r\\nnot agree on who was to be sent: no one seemed anxious to run the chance of\\r\\nbeing lost and never finding his friends again. In the end, in spite of warnings,\\r\\nhunger decided them, because Bombur kept on describing all the good things\\r\\nthat were being eaten, according to his dream, in the woodland feast; so they all\\r\\nleft the path and plunged into the forest together.\\r\\n    After a good deal of creeping and crawling they peered round the trunks and\\r\\nlooked into a clearing where some trees had been felled and the ground levelled.\\r\\nThere were many people there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green and\\r\\nbrown and sitting on sawn rings of the felled trees in a great circle. There was a\\r\\nfire in their midst and there were torches fastened to some of the trees round\\r\\nabout; but most splendid sight of all: they were eating and drinking and laughing\\r\\nmerrily.\\r\\n    The smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to\\r\\nconsult one another, every one of them got up and scrambled forwards into the\\r\\nring with the one idea of begging for some food. No sooner had the first stepped\\r\\ninto the clearing than all the lights went out as if by magic. Somebody kicked the\\r\\nfire and it went up in rockets of glittering sparks and vanished. They were lost in\\r\\na completely lightless dark and they could not even find one another, not for a\\r\\n\\x0clong time at any rate. After blundering frantically in the gloom, falling over logs,\\r\\nbumping crash into trees, and shouting and calling till they must have waked\\r\\neverything in the forest for miles, at last they managed to gather themselves in a\\r\\nbundle and count themselves by touch. By that time they had, of course, quite\\r\\nforgotten in what direction the path lay, and they were all hopelessly lost, at least\\r\\ntill morning.\\r\\n     There was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they were;\\r\\nthey did not even dare to search on the ground for scraps of food for fear of\\r\\nbecoming separated again. But they had not been lying long, and Bilbo was only\\r\\njust getting drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to watch first, said in a loud\\r\\nwhisper:\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe lights are coming out again over there, and there are more than ever of\\r\\nthem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of\\r\\ntwinkling lights, and they heard the voices and the laughter quite plainly. They\\r\\ncrept slowly towards them, in a single line, each touching the back of the one in\\r\\nfront. When they got near Thorin said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo rushing forward this time! No one is\\r\\nto stir from hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to them.\\r\\nThey won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be frightened of him\\xe2\\x80\\x94(\\xe2\\x80\\x98What about me of them?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 thought Bilbo)\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nand any way I hope they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything nasty to him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     When they got to the edge of the circle of lights they pushed Bilbo suddenly\\r\\nfrom behind. Before he had time to slip on his ring, he stumbled forward into the\\r\\nfull blaze of the fire and torches. It was no good. Out went all the lights again\\r\\nand complete darkness fell.\\r\\n     If it had been difficult collecting themselves before, it was far worse this\\r\\ntime. And they simply could not find the hobbit. Every time they counted\\r\\nthemselves it only made thirteen. They shouted and called: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBilbo Baggins!\\r\\nHobbit! You dratted hobbit! Hi! hobbit, confusticate you, where are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\nother things of that sort, but there was no answer.\\r\\n     They were just giving up hope, when Dori stumbled across him by sheer\\r\\nluck. In the dark he fell over what he thought was a log, and he found it was the\\r\\nhobbit curled up fast asleep. It took a deal of shaking to wake him, and when he\\r\\nwas awake he was not pleased at all.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was having such a lovely dream,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he grumbled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9call about having a most\\r\\ngorgeous dinner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood heavens! he has gone like Bombur,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell us about\\r\\ndreams. Dream-dinners aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any good, and we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t share them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are the best I am likely to get in this beastly place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he muttered, as he\\r\\nlay down beside the dwarves and tried to go back to sleep and find his dream\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n    But that was not the last of the lights in the forest. Later when the night must\\r\\nhave been getting old, Kili who was watching then, came and roused them all\\r\\nagain, saying:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a regular blaze of light begun not far away\\xe2\\x80\\x94hundreds of torches\\r\\nand many fires must have been lit suddenly and by magic. And hark to the\\r\\nsinging and the harps!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    After lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the\\r\\ndesire to go nearer and try once more to get help. Up they got again; and this\\r\\ntime the result was disastrous. The feast that they now saw was greater and more\\r\\nmagnificent than before; and at the head of a long line of feasters sat a woodland\\r\\nking with a crown of leaves upon his golden hair, very much as Bombur had\\r\\ndescribed the figure in his dream. The elvish folk were passing bowls from hand\\r\\nto hand and across the fires, and some were harping and many were singing.\\r\\nTheir gleaming hair was twined with flowers; green and white gems glinted on\\r\\ntheir collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were filled with\\r\\nmirth. Loud and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped Thorin in to\\r\\ntheir midst.\\r\\n    Dead silence fell in the middle of a word. Out went all light. The fires leaped\\r\\nup in black smokes. Ashes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves, and the\\r\\nwood was filled again with their clamour and their cries.\\r\\n    Bilbo found himself running round and round (as he thought) and calling and\\r\\ncalling: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Fili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin,\\r\\nBalin, Thorin Oakenshield,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while people he could not see or feel were doing the\\r\\nsame all round him (with an occasional \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBilbo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thrown in). But the cries of the\\r\\nothers got steadily further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him\\r\\nthey changed to yells and cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died\\r\\nright away, and he was left alone in complete silence and darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was one of his most miserable moments. But he soon made up his mind that\\r\\nit was no good trying to do anything till day came with some little light, and\\r\\nquite useless to go blundering about tiring himself out with no hope of any\\r\\nbreakfast to revive him. So he sat himself down with his back to a tree, and not\\r\\nfor the last time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit-hole with its beautiful\\r\\n\\x0cpantries. He was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when\\r\\nhe felt something touch him. Something like a strong sticky string was against\\r\\nhis left hand, and when he tried to move he found that his legs were already\\r\\nwrapped in the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell over.\\r\\n    Then the great spider, who had been busy tying him up while he dozed, came\\r\\nfrom behind him and came at him. He could only see the thing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes, but he\\r\\ncould feel its hairy legs as it struggled to wind its abominable threads round and\\r\\nround him. It was lucky that he had come to his senses in time. Soon he would\\r\\nnot have been able to move at all. As it was, he had a desperate fight before he\\r\\ngot free. He beat the creature off with his hands\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was trying to poison him to\\r\\nkeep him quiet, as small spiders do to flies\\xe2\\x80\\x94until he remembered his sword and\\r\\ndrew it out. Then the spider jumped back, and he had time to cut his legs loose.\\r\\nAfter that it was his turn to attack. The spider evidently was not used to things\\r\\nthat carried such stings at their sides, or it would have hurried away quicker.\\r\\nBilbo came at it before it could disappear and stuck it with his sword right in the\\r\\neyes. Then it went mad and leaped and danced and flung out its legs in horrible\\r\\njerks, until he killed it with another stroke; and then he fell down and\\r\\nremembered nothing more for a long while.\\r\\n    There was the usual dim grey light of the forest-day about him when he came\\r\\nto his senses. The spider lay dead beside him, and his sword-blade was stained\\r\\nblack. Somehow the killing of the giant spider, all alone by himself in the dark\\r\\nwithout the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of anyone else, made a great\\r\\ndifference to Mr. Baggins. He felt a different person, and much fiercer and\\r\\nbolder in spite of an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on the grass and put\\r\\nit back into its sheath.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will give you a name,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to it, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I shall call you Sting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    After that he set out to explore. The forest was grim and silent, but obviously\\r\\nhe had first of all to look for his friends, who were not likely to be very far off,\\r\\nunless they had been made prisoners by the elves (or worse things). Bilbo felt\\r\\nthat it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in what\\r\\ndirection the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the\\r\\ndwarves.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO! why did we not remember Beorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice, and Gandalf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he lamented.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a mess we are in now! We! I only wish it was we: it is horrible being all\\r\\nalone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    In the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which\\r\\nthe cries for help had come in the night\\xe2\\x80\\x94and by luck (he was born with a good\\r\\n\\x0cshare of it) he guessed more or less right, as you will see. Having made up his\\r\\nmind he crept along as cleverly as he could. Hobbits are clever at quietness,\\r\\nespecially in woods, as I have already told you; also Bilbo had slipped on his\\r\\nring before he started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard him coming.\\r\\n    He had picked his way stealthily for some distance, when he noticed a place\\r\\nof dense black shadow ahead of him, black even for that forest, like a patch of\\r\\nmidnight that had never been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw that it was\\r\\nmade by spider-webs one behind and over and tangled with another. Suddenly he\\r\\nsaw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches above\\r\\nhim, and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him.\\r\\nStanding behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time, and then in\\r\\nthe silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these loathsome creatures\\r\\nwere speaking one to another. Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and\\r\\nhissing, but he could make out many of the words that they said. They were\\r\\ntalking about the dwarves!\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was a sharp struggle, but worth it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat nasty thick skins they\\r\\nhave to be sure, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll wager there is good juice inside.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAye, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make fine eating, when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve hung a bit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said another.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hang \\xe2\\x80\\x99em too long,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a third. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not as fat as they might be.\\r\\nBeen feeding none too well of late, I should guess.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKill \\xe2\\x80\\x99em, I say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hissed a fourth; \\xe2\\x80\\x9ckill \\xe2\\x80\\x99em now and hang \\xe2\\x80\\x99em dead for a\\r\\nwhile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dead now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll warrant,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the first.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat they are not. I saw one a-struggling just now. Just coming round again,\\r\\nI should say, after a bee-autiful sleep. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll show you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    With that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope till it came to a dozen\\r\\nbundles hanging in a row from a high branch. Bilbo was horrified, now that he\\r\\nnoticed them for the first time dangling in the shadows, to see a dwarvish foot\\r\\nsticking out of the bottoms of some of the bundles, or here and there the tip of a\\r\\nnose, or a bit of beard or of a hood.\\r\\n    To the fattest of these bundles the spider went\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is poor old Bombur, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nbet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x94and nipped hard at the nose that stuck out. There was a\\r\\nmuffled yelp inside, and a toe shot up and kicked the spider straight and hard.\\r\\nThere was life in Bombur still. There was a noise like the kicking of a flabby\\r\\nfootball, and the enraged spider fell off the branch, only catching itself with its\\r\\nown thread just in time.\\r\\n    The others laughed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou were quite right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe meat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alive and\\r\\n\\x0ckicking!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll soon put an end to that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hissed the angry spider climbing back onto the\\r\\nbranch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something. He could not\\r\\nget up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot with; but looking about he saw\\r\\nthat in this place there were many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry\\r\\nlittle watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and it did not take\\r\\nhim long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted his hand cosily. As a\\r\\nboy he used to practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and\\r\\neven birds, got out of his way as quick as lightning if they saw him stoop; and\\r\\neven grownup he had still spent a deal of his time at quoits, dart-throwing,\\r\\nshooting at the wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming and\\r\\nthrowing sort\\xe2\\x80\\x94indeed he could do lots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings,\\r\\nasking riddles and cooking, that I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had time to tell you about. There is no\\r\\ntime now. While he was picking up stones, the spider had reached Bombur, and\\r\\nsoon he would have been dead. At that moment Bilbo threw. The stone struck\\r\\nthe spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the\\r\\nground, with all its legs curled up.\\r\\n     The next stone went whizzing through a big web, snapping its cords, and\\r\\ntaking off the spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. After that there was\\r\\na deal of commotion in the spider-colony, and they forgot the dwarves for a bit, I\\r\\ncan tell you. They could not see Bilbo, but they could make a good guess at the\\r\\ndirection from which the stones were coming. As quick as lightning they came\\r\\nrunning and swinging towards the hobbit, flinging out their long threads in all\\r\\ndirections, till the air seemed full of waving snares.\\r\\n     Bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a different place. The idea came to him\\r\\nto lead the furious spiders further and further away from the dwarves, if he\\r\\ncould; to make them curious, excited and angry all at once. When about fifty had\\r\\ngone off to the place where he had stood before, he threw some more stones at\\r\\nthese, and at others that had stopped behind; then dancing among the trees he\\r\\nbegan to sing a song to infuriate them and bring them all after him, and also to\\r\\nlet the dwarves hear his voice.\\r\\n     This is what he sang:\\r\\n\\x0c       Old fat spider spinning in a tree!\\r\\n       Old fat spider can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see me!\\r\\n         Attercop! Attercop!\\r\\n            Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you stop,\\r\\n       Stop your spinning and look for me?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Old Tomnoddy, all big body,\\r\\n       Old Tomnoddy can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spy me!\\r\\n         Attercop! Attercop!\\r\\n            Down you drop!\\r\\n       You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never catch me up your tree!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    Not very good perhaps, but then you must remember that he had to make it\\r\\nup himself, on the spur of a very awkward moment. It did what he wanted any\\r\\nway. As he sang he threw some more stones and stamped. Practically all the\\r\\nspiders in the place came after him: some dropped to the ground, others raced\\r\\nalong the branches, swung from tree to tree, or cast new ropes across the dark\\r\\nspaces. They made for his noise far quicker than he had expected. They were\\r\\nfrightfully angry. Quite apart from the stones no spider has ever liked being\\r\\ncalled Attercop, and Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody.\\r\\n    Off Bilbo scuttled to a fresh place, but several of the spiders had run now to\\r\\ndifferent points in the glade where they lived, and were busy spinning webs\\r\\nacross all the spaces between the tree-stems. Very soon the hobbit would be\\r\\ncaught in a thick fence of them all round him\\xe2\\x80\\x94that at least was the spiders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 idea.\\r\\nStanding now in the middle of the hunting and spinning insects Bilbo plucked up\\r\\nhis courage and began a new song:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Lazy Lob and crazy Cob\\r\\n       are weaving webs to wind me.\\r\\n       I am far more sweet than other meat,\\r\\n       but still they cannot find me!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Here am I, naughty little fly;\\r\\n       you are fat and lazy.\\r\\n\\x0c       You cannot trap me, though you try,\\r\\n       in your cobwebs crazy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    With that he turned and found that the last space between two tall trees had\\r\\nbeen closed with a web\\xe2\\x80\\x94but luckily not a proper web, only great strands of\\r\\ndouble-thick spider-rope run hastily backwards and forwards from trunk to\\r\\ntrunk. Out came his little sword. He slashed the threads to pieces and went off\\r\\nsinging.\\r\\n    The spiders saw the sword, though I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose they knew what it was,\\r\\nand at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the\\r\\nground and the branches, hairy legs waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes\\r\\npopping, full of froth and rage. They followed him into the forest until Bilbo had\\r\\ngone as far as he dared. Then quieter than a mouse he stole back.\\r\\n    He had precious little time, he knew, before the spiders were disgusted and\\r\\ncame back to their trees where the dwarves were hung. In the meanwhile he had\\r\\nto rescue them. The worst part of the job was getting up on to the long branch\\r\\nwhere the bundles were dangling. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose he would have managed it, if a\\r\\nspider had not luckily left a rope hanging down; with its help, though it stuck to\\r\\nhis hand and hurt him, he scrambled up\\xe2\\x80\\x94only to meet an old slow wicked fat-\\r\\nbodied spider who had remained behind to guard the prisoners, and had been\\r\\nbusy pinching them to see which was the juiciest to eat. It had thought of starting\\r\\nthe feast while the others were away, but Mr. Baggins was in a hurry, and before\\r\\nthe spider knew what was happening it felt his sting and rolled off the branch\\r\\ndead.\\r\\n    Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next job was to loose a dwarf. What was he to do? If he cut the string\\r\\nwhich hung him up, the wretched dwarf would tumble thump to the ground a\\r\\ngood way below. Wriggling along the branch (which made all the poor dwarves\\r\\ndance and dangle like ripe fruit) he reached the first bundle.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFili or Kili,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought by the tip of a blue hood sticking out at the top.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost likely Fili,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought by the tip of a long nose poking out of the winding\\r\\nthreads. He managed by leaning over to cut most of the strong sticky threads that\\r\\nbound him round, and then, sure enough, with a kick and a struggle most of Fili\\r\\nemerged. I am afraid Bilbo actually laughed at the sight of him jerking his stiff\\r\\narms and legs as he danced on the spider-string under his armpits, just like one\\r\\nof those funny toys bobbing on a wire.\\r\\n    Somehow or other Fili was got on to the branch, and then he did his best to\\r\\n\\x0chelp the hobbit, although he was feeling very sick and ill from spider-poison, and\\r\\nfrom hanging most of the night and the next day wound round and round with\\r\\nonly his nose to breathe through. It took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of\\r\\nhis eyes and eyebrows, and as for his beard, he had to cut most of it off. Well,\\r\\nbetween them they started to haul up first one dwarf and then another and slash\\r\\nthem free. None of them were better off than Fili, and some of them were worse.\\r\\nSome had hardly been able to breathe at all (long noses are sometimes useful\\r\\nyou see) and some had been more poisoned.\\r\\n    In this way they rescued Kili, Bifur, Bofur, Dori and Nori. Poor old Bombur\\r\\nwas so exhausted\\xe2\\x80\\x94he was the fattest and had been constantly pinched and\\r\\npoked\\xe2\\x80\\x94that he just rolled off the branch and fell plop on to the ground,\\r\\nfortunately on to leaves, and lay there. But there were still five dwarves hanging\\r\\nat the end of the branch when the spiders began to come back, more full of rage\\r\\nthan ever.\\r\\n    Bilbo immediately went to the end of the branch nearest the tree-trunk and\\r\\nkept back those that crawled up. He had taken off his ring when he rescued Fili\\r\\nand forgotten to put it on again, so now they all began to splutter and hiss:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow we see you, you nasty little creature! We will eat you and leave your\\r\\nbones and skin hanging on a tree. Ugh! he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a sting has he? Well, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get\\r\\nhim all the same, and then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hang him head downwards for a day or two.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    While this was going on, the other dwarves were working at the rest of the\\r\\ncaptives, and cutting at the threads with their knives. Soon all would be free,\\r\\nthough it was not clear what would happen after that. The spiders had caught\\r\\nthem pretty easily the night before, but that had been unawares and in the dark.\\r\\nThis time there looked like being a horrible battle.\\r\\n    Suddenly Bilbo noticed that some of the spiders had gathered round old\\r\\nBombur on the floor, and had tied him up again and were dragging him away. He\\r\\ngave a shout and slashed at the spiders in front of him. They quickly gave way,\\r\\nand he scrambled and fell down the tree right into the middle of those on the\\r\\nground. His little sword was something new in the way of stings for them. How\\r\\nit darted to and fro! It shone with delight as he stabbed at them. Half a dozen\\r\\nwere killed before the rest drew off and left Bombur to Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome down! Come down!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted to the dwarves on the branch. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nstay up there and be netted!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For he saw spiders swarming up all the\\r\\nneighbouring trees, and crawling along the boughs above the heads of the\\r\\ndwarves.\\r\\n    Down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap,\\r\\n\\x0cmost of them very shaky and little use on their legs. There they were at last,\\r\\ntwelve of them counting poor old Bombur, who was being propped up on either\\r\\nside by his cousin Bifur, and his brother Bofur; and Bilbo was dancing about and\\r\\nwaving his Sting; and hundreds of angry spiders were goggling at them all round\\r\\nand about and above. It looked pretty hopeless.\\r\\n    Then the battle began. Some of the dwarves had knives, and some had sticks,\\r\\nand all of them could get at stones; and Bilbo had his elvish dagger. Again and\\r\\nagain the spiders were beaten off, and many of them were killed. But it could not\\r\\ngo on for long. Bilbo was nearly tired out; only four of the dwarves were able to\\r\\nstand firmly, and soon they would all be overpowered like weary flies. Already\\r\\nthe spiders were beginning to weave their webs all round them again from tree to\\r\\ntree.\\r\\n    In the end Bilbo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the\\r\\nsecret of his ring. He was rather sorry about it, but it could not be helped.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am going to disappear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall draw the spiders off, if I can; and\\r\\nyou must keep together and make in the opposite direction. To the left there, that\\r\\nis more or less the way towards the place where we last saw the elf-fires.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    It was difficult to get them to understand, what with their dizzy heads, and\\r\\nthe shouts, and the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones; but at last\\r\\nBilbo felt he could delay no longer\\xe2\\x80\\x94the spiders were drawing their circle ever\\r\\ncloser. He suddenly slipped on his ring, and to the great astonishment of the\\r\\ndwarves he vanished.\\r\\n    Soon there came the sound of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLazy Lob\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAttercop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from among the\\r\\ntrees away on the right. That upset the spiders greatly. They stopped advancing,\\r\\nand some went off in the direction of the voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAttercop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d made them so angry\\r\\nthat they lost their wits. Then Balin, who had grasped Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan better than the\\r\\nrest, led an attack. The dwarves huddled together in a knot, and sending a\\r\\nshower of stones they drove at the spiders on the left, and burst through the ring.\\r\\nAway behind them now the shouting and singing suddenly stopped.\\r\\n    Hoping desperately that Bilbo had not been caught the dwarves went on. Not\\r\\nfast enough, though. They were sick and weary, and they could not go much\\r\\nbetter than a hobble and a wobble, though many of the spiders were close\\r\\nbehind. Every now and then they had to turn and fight the creatures that were\\r\\novertaking them; and already some spiders were in the trees above them and\\r\\nthrowing down their long clinging threads.\\r\\n    Things were looking pretty bad again, when suddenly Bilbo reappeared, and\\r\\ncharged into the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the side.\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on! Go on!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will do the stinging!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    And he did. He darted backwards and forwards, slashing at spider-threads,\\r\\nhacking at their legs, and stabbing at their fat bodies if they came too near. The\\r\\nspiders swelled with rage, and spluttered and frothed, and hissed out horrible\\r\\ncurses; but they had become mortally afraid of Sting, and dared not come very\\r\\nnear, now that it had come back. So curse as they would, their prey moved\\r\\nslowly but steadily away. It was a most terrible business, and seemed to take\\r\\nhours. But at last, just when Bilbo felt that he could not lift his hand for a single\\r\\nstroke more, the spiders suddenly gave it up, and followed them no more, but\\r\\nwent back disappointed to their dark colony.\\r\\n    The dwarves then noticed that they had come to the edge of a ring where elf-\\r\\nfires had been. Whether it was one of those they had seen the night before, they\\r\\ncould not tell. But it seemed that some good magic lingered in such spots, which\\r\\nthe spiders did not like. At any rate here the light was greener, and the boughs\\r\\nless thick and threatening, and they had a chance to rest and draw breath.\\r\\n    There they lay for some time, puffing and panting. But very soon they began\\r\\nto ask questions. They had to have the whole vanishing business carefully\\r\\nexplained, and the finding of the ring interested them so much that for a while\\r\\nthey forgot their own troubles. Balin in particular insisted on having the Gollum\\r\\nstory, riddles and all, told all over again, with the ring in its proper place. But\\r\\nafter a time the light began to fail, and then other questions were asked. Where\\r\\nwere they, and where was their path, and where was there any food, and what\\r\\nwere they going to do next? These questions they asked over and over again, and\\r\\nit was from little Bilbo that they seemed to expect to get the answers. From\\r\\nwhich you can see that they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins very\\r\\nmuch, and had begun to have a great respect for him (as Gandalf had said they\\r\\nwould). Indeed they really expected him to think of some wonderful plan for\\r\\nhelping them, and were not merely grumbling. They knew only too well that\\r\\nthey would soon all have been dead, if it had not been for the hobbit; and they\\r\\nthanked him many times. Some of them even got up and bowed right to the\\r\\nground before him, though they fell over with the effort, and could not get on\\r\\ntheir legs again for some time. Knowing the truth about the vanishing did not\\r\\nlessen their opinion of Bilbo at all; for they saw that he had some wits, as well as\\r\\nluck and a magic ring\\xe2\\x80\\x94and all three are very useful possessions. In fact they\\r\\npraised him so much that Bilbo began to feel there really was something of a\\r\\nbold adventurer about himself after all, though he would have felt a lot bolder\\r\\nstill, if there had been anything to eat.\\r\\n\\x0c    But there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them were fit to go and\\r\\nlook for anything, or to search for the lost path. The lost path! No other idea\\r\\nwould come into Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at the\\r\\nendless trees; and after a while they all fell silent again. All except Balin. Long\\r\\nafter the others had stopped talking and shut their eyes, he kept on muttering and\\r\\nchuckling to himself.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGollum! Well I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m blest! So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how he sneaked past me, is it? Now I\\r\\nknow! Just crept quietly along did you, Mr. Baggins? Buttons all over the\\r\\ndoorstep! Good old Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x94Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x94Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x94bo\\xe2\\x80\\x94bo\\xe2\\x80\\x94bo\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And then he fell\\r\\nasleep, and there was complete silence for a long while.\\r\\n    All of a sudden Dwalin opened an eye, and looked round at them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is\\r\\nThorin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n    It was a terrible shock. Of course there were only thirteen of them, twelve\\r\\ndwarves and the hobbit. Where indeed was Thorin? They wondered what evil\\r\\nfate had befallen him, magic or dark monsters; and shuddered as they lay lost in\\r\\nthe forest. There they dropped off one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of\\r\\nhorrible dreams, as evening wore to black night; and there we must leave them\\r\\nfor the present, too sick and weary to set guards or to take turns at watching.\\r\\n    Thorin had been caught much faster than they had. You remember Bilbo\\r\\nfalling like a log into sleep, as he stepped into a circle of light? The next time it\\r\\nhad been Thorin who stepped forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a\\r\\nstone enchanted. All the noise of the dwarves lost in the night, their cries as the\\r\\nspiders caught them and bound them, and all the sounds of the battle next day,\\r\\nhad passed over him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come to him, and bound\\r\\nhim, and carried him away.\\r\\n    The feasting people were Wood-elves, of course. These are not wicked folk.\\r\\nIf they have a fault it is distrust of strangers. Though their magic was strong,\\r\\neven in those days they were wary. They differed from the High Elves of the\\r\\nWest, and were more dangerous and less wise. For most of them (together with\\r\\ntheir scattered relations in the hills and mountains) were descended from the\\r\\nancient tribes that never went to Faerie in the West. There the Light-elves and\\r\\nthe Deep-elves and the Sea-elves went and lived for ages, and grew fairer and\\r\\nwiser and more learned, and invented their magic and their cunning craft in the\\r\\nmaking of beautiful and marvellous things, before some came back into the\\r\\nWide World. In the Wide World the Wood-elves lingered in the twilight of our\\r\\nSun and Moon, but loved best the stars; and they wandered in the great forests\\r\\nthat grew tall in lands that are now lost. They dwelt most often by the edges of\\r\\n\\x0cthe woods, from which they could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run over\\r\\nthe open lands by moonlight or starlight; and after the coming of Men they took\\r\\never more and more to the gloaming and the dusk. Still elves they were and\\r\\nremain, and that is Good People.\\r\\n    In a great cave some miles within the edge of Mirkwood on its eastern side\\r\\nthere lived at this time their greatest king. Before his huge doors of stone a river\\r\\nran out of the heights of the forest and flowed on and out into the marshes at the\\r\\nfeet of the high wooded lands. This great cave, from which countless smaller\\r\\nones opened out on every side, wound far underground and had many passages\\r\\nand wide halls; but it was lighter and more wholesome than any goblin-dwelling,\\r\\nand neither so deep nor so dangerous. In fact the subjects of the king mostly\\r\\nlived and hunted in the open woods, and had houses or huts on the ground and in\\r\\nthe branches. The beeches were their favourite trees. The king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cave was his\\r\\npalace, and the strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of his people against\\r\\ntheir enemies.\\r\\n    It was also the dungeon of his prisoners. So to the cave they dragged Thorin\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94not too gently, for they did not love dwarves, and thought he was an enemy. In\\r\\nancient days they had had wars with some of the dwarves, whom they accused of\\r\\nstealing their treasure. It is only fair to say that the dwarves gave a different\\r\\naccount, and said that they only took what was their due, for the elf-king had\\r\\nbargained with them to shape his raw gold and silver, and had afterwards refused\\r\\nto give them their pay. If the elf-king had a weakness it was for treasure,\\r\\nespecially for silver and white gems; and though his hoard was rich, he was ever\\r\\neager for more, since he had not yet as great a treasure as other elf-lords of old.\\r\\nHis people neither mined nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother much\\r\\nwith trade or with tilling the earth. All this was well known to every dwarf,\\r\\nthough Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s family had had nothing to do with the old quarrel I have spoken\\r\\nof. Consequently Thorin was angry at their treatment of him, when they took\\r\\ntheir spell off him and he came to his senses; and also he was determined that no\\r\\nword of gold or jewels should be dragged out of him.\\r\\n    The king looked sternly on Thorin, when he was brought before him, and\\r\\nasked him many questions. But Thorin would only say that he was starving.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy did you and your folk three times try to attack my people at their\\r\\nmerrymaking?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the king.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe did not attack them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Thorin; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe came to beg, because we\\r\\nwere starving.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere are your friends now, and what are they doing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, but I expect starving in the forest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat were you doing in the forest?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLooking for food and drink, because we were starving.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what brought you into the forest at all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the king angrily.\\r\\n    At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the king. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTake him away and keep him safe, until he feels\\r\\ninclined to tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then the elves put thongs on him, and shut him in one of the inmost caves\\r\\nwith strong wooden doors, and left him. They gave him food and drink, plenty of\\r\\nboth, if not very fine; for Wood-elves were not goblins, and were reasonably\\r\\nwell-behaved even to their worst enemies, when they captured them. The giant\\r\\nspiders were the only living things that they had no mercy upon.\\r\\n    There in the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dungeon poor Thorin lay; and after he had got over his\\r\\nthankfulness for bread and meat and water, he began to wonder what had\\r\\nbecome of his unfortunate friends. It was not very long before he discovered; but\\r\\nthat belongs to the next chapter and the beginning of another adventure in which\\r\\nthe hobbit again showed his usefulness.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter IX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBARRELS OUT OF BOND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves made one last\\r\\ndespairing effort to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst. They\\r\\ngot up and staggered on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them\\r\\nguessed to be the one in which the path lay; but they never found out if they\\r\\nwere right. Such day as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into\\r\\nthe blackness of night, when suddenly out sprang the light of many torches all\\r\\nround them, like hundreds of red stars. Out leaped Wood-elves with their bows\\r\\nand spears and called the dwarves to halt.\\r\\n    There was no thought of a fight. Even if the dwarves had not been in such a\\r\\nstate that they were actually glad to be captured, their small knives, the only\\r\\nweapons they had, would have been of no use against the arrows of the elves that\\r\\ncould hit a bird\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eye in the dark. So they simply stopped dead and sat down and\\r\\nwaited\\xe2\\x80\\x94all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one\\r\\nside. That is why, when the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one behind\\r\\nthe other, and counted them, they never found or counted the hobbit.\\r\\n    Nor did they hear or feel him trotting along well behind their torch-light as\\r\\nthey led off their prisoners into the forest. Each dwarf was blindfold, but that did\\r\\nnot make much difference, for even Bilbo with the use of his eyes could not see\\r\\nwhere they were going, and neither he nor the others knew where they had\\r\\nstarted from anyway. Bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the torches, for\\r\\nthe elves were making the dwarves go as fast as ever they could, sick and weary\\r\\nas they were. The king had ordered them to make haste. Suddenly the torches\\r\\nstopped, and the hobbit had just time to catch them up before they began to cross\\r\\nthe bridge. This was the bridge that led across the river to the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doors. The\\r\\nwater flowed dark and swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates\\r\\n\\x0cbefore the mouth of a huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered\\r\\nwith trees. There the great beeches came right down to the bank, till their feet\\r\\nwere in the stream.\\r\\n    Across the bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the\\r\\nrear. He did not at all like the look of the cavern-mouth, and he only made up his\\r\\nmind not to desert his friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of the last\\r\\nelves, before the great gates of the king closed behind them with a clang.\\r\\n    Inside the passages were lit with red torch-light, and the elf-guards sang as\\r\\nthey marched along the twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. These were not\\r\\nlike those of the goblin-cities; they were smaller, less deep underground, and\\r\\nfilled with a cleaner air. In a great hall with pillars hewn out of the living stone\\r\\nsat the Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of berries\\r\\nand red leaves, for the autumn was come again. In the spring he wore a crown of\\r\\nwoodland flowers. In his hand he held a carven staff of oak.\\r\\n\\x0cThe Elvenking's Gate\\r\\n\\x0c    The prisoners were brought before him; and though he looked grimly at\\r\\nthem, he told his men to unbind them, for they were ragged and weary. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides\\r\\nthey need no ropes in here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no escape from my magic doors\\r\\nfor those who are once brought inside.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Long and searchingly he questioned the dwarves about their doings, and\\r\\nwhere they were going to, and where they were coming from; but he got little\\r\\nmore news out of them than out of Thorin. They were surly and angry and did\\r\\nnot even pretend to be polite.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat have we done, O king?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin, who was the eldest left. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it a\\r\\ncrime to be lost in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be trapped by spiders?\\r\\nAre the spiders your tame beasts or your pets, if killing them makes you angry?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Such a question of course made the king angrier than ever, and he answered:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a crime to wander in my realm without leave. Do you forget that you were\\r\\nin my kingdom, using the road that my people made? Did you not three times\\r\\npursue and trouble my people in the forest and rouse the spiders with your riot\\r\\nand clamour? After all the disturbance you have made I have a right to know\\r\\nwhat brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep you all in\\r\\nprison until you have learned sense and manners!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then he ordered the dwarves each to be put in a separate cell and to be given\\r\\nfood and drink, but not to be allowed to pass the doors of their little prisons, until\\r\\none at least of them was willing to tell him all he wanted to know. But he did not\\r\\ntell them that Thorin was also a prisoner with him. It was Bilbo who found that\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Mr. Baggins\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was a weary long time that he lived in that place all alone,\\r\\nand always in hiding, never daring to take off his ring, hardly daring to sleep,\\r\\neven tucked away in the darkest and remotest corners he could find. For\\r\\nsomething to do he took to wandering about the Elvenking\\xe2\\x80\\x99s palace. Magic shut\\r\\nthe gates, but he could sometimes get out, if he was quick. Companies of the\\r\\nWood-elves, sometimes with the king at their head, would from time to time ride\\r\\nout to hunt, or to other business in the woods and in the lands to the East. Then if\\r\\nBilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just behind them; though it was a\\r\\ndangerous thing to do. More than once he was nearly caught in the doors, as they\\r\\nclashed together when the last elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among\\r\\nthem because of his shadow (altogether thin and wobbly as it was in torchlight),\\r\\nor for fear of being bumped into and discovered. And when he did go out, which\\r\\n\\x0cwas not very often, he did no good. He did not wish to desert the dwarves, and\\r\\nindeed he did not know where in the world to go without them. He could not\\r\\nkeep up with the hunting elves all the time they were out, so he never discovered\\r\\nthe ways out of the wood, and was left to wander miserably in the forest,\\r\\nterrified of losing himself, until a chance came of returning. He was hungry too\\r\\noutside, for he was no hunter; but inside the caves he could pick up a living of\\r\\nsome sort by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am like a burglar that can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get away, but must go on miserably burgling\\r\\nthe same house day after day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the dreariest and dullest part\\r\\nof all this wretched, tiresome, uncomfortable adventure! I wish I was back in my\\r\\nhobbit-hole by my own warm fireside with the lamp shining!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He often wished,\\r\\ntoo, that he could get a message for help sent to the wizard, but that of course\\r\\nwas quite impossible; and he soon realized that if anything was to be done, it\\r\\nwould have to be done by Mr. Baggins, alone and unaided.\\r\\n    Eventually, after a week or two of this sneaking sort of life, by watching and\\r\\nfollowing the guards and taking what chances he could, he managed to find out\\r\\nwhere each dwarf was kept. He found all their twelve cells in different parts of\\r\\nthe palace, and after a time he got to know his way about very well. What was\\r\\nhis surprise one day to overhear some of the guards talking and to learn that\\r\\nthere was another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep dark place. He guessed\\r\\nat once, of course, that that was Thorin; and after a while he found that his guess\\r\\nwas right. At last after many difficulties he managed to find the place when no\\r\\none was about, and to have a word with the chief of the dwarves.\\r\\n    Thorin was too wretched to be angry any longer at his misfortunes, and was\\r\\neven beginning to think of telling the king all about his treasure and his quest\\r\\n(which shows how low-spirited he had become), when he heard Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s little\\r\\nvoice at his keyhole. He could hardly believe his ears. Soon however he made up\\r\\nhis mind that he could not be mistaken, and he came to the door and had a long\\r\\nwhispered talk with the hobbit on the other side.\\r\\n    So it was that Bilbo was able to take secretly Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s message to each of the\\r\\nother imprisoned dwarves, telling them that Thorin their chief was also in prison\\r\\nclose at hand, and that no one was to reveal their errand to the king, not yet, nor\\r\\nbefore Thorin gave the word. For Thorin had taken heart again hearing how the\\r\\nhobbit had rescued his companions from the spiders, and was determined once\\r\\nmore not to ransom himself with promises to the king of a share in the treasure,\\r\\nuntil all hope of escaping in any other way had disappeared; until in fact the\\r\\nremarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of whom he began to have a very high\\r\\n\\x0copinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever.\\r\\n    The other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. They all thought\\r\\ntheir own shares in the treasure (which they quite regarded as theirs, in spite of\\r\\ntheir plight and the still unconquered dragon) would suffer seriously if the\\r\\nWood-elves claimed part of it, and they all trusted Bilbo. Just what Gandalf had\\r\\nsaid would happen, you see. Perhaps that was part of his reason for going off and\\r\\nleaving them.\\r\\n    Bilbo, however, did not feel nearly so hopeful as they did. He did not like\\r\\nbeing depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand. But\\r\\nthat was no use: probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay between them.\\r\\nHe sat and thought and thought, until his head nearly burst, but no bright idea\\r\\nwould come. One invisible ring was a very fine thing, but it was not much good\\r\\namong fourteen. But of course, as you have guessed, he did rescue his friends in\\r\\nthe end, and this is how it happened.\\r\\n    One day, nosing and wandering about, Bilbo discovered a very interesting\\r\\nthing: the great gates were not the only entrance to the caves. A stream flowed\\r\\nunder part of the lowest regions of the palace, and joined the Forest River some\\r\\nway further to the east, beyond the steep slope out of which the main mouth\\r\\nopened. Where this underground watercourse came forth from the hillside there\\r\\nwas a water-gate. There the rocky roof came down close to the surface of the\\r\\nstream, and from it a portcullis could be dropped right to the bed of the river to\\r\\nprevent anyone coming in or out that way. But the portcullis was often open, for\\r\\na good deal of traffic went out and in by the water-gate. If anyone had come in\\r\\nthat way, he would have found himself in a dark rough tunnel leading deep into\\r\\nthe heart of the hill; but at one point where it passed under the caves the roof had\\r\\nbeen cut away and covered with great oaken trapdoors. These opened upwards\\r\\ninto the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cellars. There stood barrels, and barrels, and barrels; for the\\r\\nWood-elves, and especially their king, were very fond of wine, though no vines\\r\\ngrew in those parts. The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away,\\r\\nfrom their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands.\\r\\n    Hiding behind one of the largest barrels Bilbo discovered the trapdoors and\\r\\ntheir use, and lurking there, listening to the talk of the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s servants, he learned\\r\\nhow the wine and other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to the Long\\r\\nLake. It seemed a town of Men still throve there, built out on bridges far into the\\r\\nwater as a protection against enemies of all sorts, and especially against the\\r\\ndragon of the Mountain. From Lake-town the barrels were brought up the Forest\\r\\nRiver. Often they were just tied together like big rafts and poled or rowed up the\\r\\n\\x0cstream; sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats.\\r\\n    When the barrels were empty the elves cast them through the trapdoors,\\r\\nopened the water-gate, and out the barrels floated on the stream, bobbing along,\\r\\nuntil they were carried by the current to a place far down the river where the\\r\\nbank jutted out, near to the very eastern edge of Mirkwood. There they were\\r\\ncollected and tied together and floated back to Lake-town, which stood close to\\r\\nthe point where the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time Bilbo sat and thought about this water-gate, and wondered if it\\r\\ncould be used for the escape of his friends, and at last he had the desperate\\r\\nbeginnings of a plan.\\r\\n    The evening meal had been taken to the prisoners. The guards were tramping\\r\\naway down the passages taking the torchlight with them and leaving everything\\r\\nin darkness. Then Bilbo heard the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s butler bidding the chief of the guards\\r\\ngood-night.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow come with me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand taste the new wine that has just come in.\\r\\nI shall be hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the empty wood, so let us\\r\\nhave a drink first to help the labour.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery good,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d laughed the chief of the guards. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll taste with you, and see if it\\r\\nis fit for the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s table. There is a feast tonight and it would not do to send up\\r\\npoor stuff!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with him\\r\\nand he had a chance at once to try his desperate plan. He followed the two elves,\\r\\nuntil they entered a small cellar and sat down at a table on which two large\\r\\nflagons were set. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an\\r\\nunusual kind was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to make a wood-elf\\r\\ndrowsy; but this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens\\r\\nof Dorwinion, not meant for his soldiers or his servants, but for the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feasts\\r\\nonly, and for smaller bowls not for the butler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great flagons.\\r\\n    Very soon the chief guard nodded his head, then he laid it on the table and\\r\\nfell fast asleep. The butler went on talking and laughing to himself for a while\\r\\nwithout seeming to notice, but soon his head too nodded to the table, and he fell\\r\\nasleep and snored beside his friend. Then in crept the hobbit. Very soon the chief\\r\\n\\x0cguard had no keys, but Bilbo was trotting as fast as he could along the passages\\r\\ntowards the cells. The great bunch seemed very heavy to his arms, and his heart\\r\\nwas often in his mouth, in spite of his ring, for he could not prevent the keys\\r\\nfrom making every now and then a loud clink and clank, which put him all in a\\r\\ntremble.\\r\\n    First he unlocked Balin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s door, and locked it again carefully as soon as the\\r\\ndwarf was outside. Balin was most surprised, as you can imagine; but glad as he\\r\\nwas to get out of his wearisome little stone room, he wanted to stop and ask\\r\\nquestions, and know what Bilbo was going to do, and all about it.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo time now!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the hobbit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou just follow me! We must all keep\\r\\ntogether and not risk getting separated. All of us must escape or none, and this is\\r\\nour last chance. If this is found out, goodness knows where the king will put you\\r\\nnext, with chains on your hands and feet too, I expect. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t argue, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\ngood fellow!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then off he went from door to door, until his following had grown to twelve\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94none of them any too nimble, what with the dark, and what with their long\\r\\nimprisonment. Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart thumped every time one of them bumped into\\r\\nanother, or grunted or whispered in the dark. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDrat this dwarvish racket!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said\\r\\nto himself. But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact there\\r\\nwas a great autumn feast in the woods that night, and in the halls above. Nearly\\r\\nall the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s folk were merrymaking.\\r\\n    At last after much blundering they came to Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dungeon, far down in a\\r\\ndeep place and fortunately not far from the cellars.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUpon my word!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and\\r\\njoin his friends, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGandalf spoke true, as usual! A pretty fine burglar you make, it\\r\\nseems, when the time comes. I am sure we are all for ever at your service,\\r\\nwhatever happens after this. But what comes next?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but\\r\\nhe did not feel at all sure how the dwarves would take it. His fears were quite\\r\\njustified, for they did not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of\\r\\ntheir danger.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shall be bruised and battered to pieces, and drowned too, for certain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nthey muttered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe thought you had got some sensible notion, when you\\r\\nmanaged to get hold of the keys. This is a mad idea!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome\\r\\nalong back to your nice cells, and I will lock you all in again, and you can sit\\r\\nthere comfortably and think of a better plan\\xe2\\x80\\x94but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose I shall ever get\\r\\n\\x0chold of the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    That was too much for them, and they calmed down. In the end, of course,\\r\\nthey had to do just what Bilbo suggested, because it was obviously impossible\\r\\nfor them to try and find their way into the upper halls, or to fight their way out of\\r\\ngates that closed by magic; and it was no good grumbling in the passages until\\r\\nthey were caught again. So following the hobbit, down into the lowest cellars\\r\\nthey crept. They passed a door through which the chief guard and the butler\\r\\ncould be seen still happily snoring with smiles upon their faces. The wine of\\r\\nDorwinion brings deep and pleasant dreams. There would be a different\\r\\nexpression on the face of the chief guard next day, even though Bilbo, before\\r\\nthey went on, stole in and kind-heartedly put the keys back on his belt.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat will save him some of the trouble he is in for,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Baggins to\\r\\nhimself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a bad fellow, and quite decent to the prisoners. It will puzzle\\r\\nthem all too. They will think we had a very strong magic to pass through all\\r\\nthose locked doors and disappear. Disappear! We have got to get busy very\\r\\nquick, if that is to happen!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBalin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they\\r\\nstirred. The rest went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors. There was\\r\\nlittle time to lose. Before long, as Bilbo knew, some elves were under orders to\\r\\ncome down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into the\\r\\nstream. These were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor\\r\\nwaiting to be pushed off. Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not\\r\\nmuch use, as they could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise,\\r\\nnor could they easily be secured again. But among them were several others,\\r\\nwhich had been used for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of\\r\\nthings, to the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s palace.\\r\\n     They soon found thirteen with room enough for a dwarf in each. In fact some\\r\\nwere too roomy, and as they climbed in the dwarves thought anxiously of the\\r\\nshaking and the bumping they would get inside, though Bilbo did his best to find\\r\\nstraw and other stuff to pack them in as cosily as could be managed in a short\\r\\ntime. At last twelve dwarves were stowed. Thorin had given a lot of trouble, and\\r\\nturned and twisted in his tub and grumbled like a large dog in a small kennel;\\r\\nwhile Balin, who came last, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was\\r\\nstifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo had done what he could to close holes\\r\\nin the sides of the barrels, and to fix on all the lids as safely as could be\\r\\n\\x0cmanaged, and now he was left alone again, running round putting the finishing\\r\\ntouches to the packing, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off.\\r\\n    It had not been done a bit too soon. Only a minute or two after Balin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lid had\\r\\nbeen fitted on there came the sound of voices and the flicker of lights. A number\\r\\nof elves came laughing and talking into the cellars and singing snatches of song.\\r\\nThey had left a merry feast in one of the halls and were bent on returning as soon\\r\\nas they could.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s old Galion, the butler?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen him at the tables\\r\\ntonight. He ought to be here now to show us what is to be done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be angry if the old slowcoach is late,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said another. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no wish to\\r\\nwaste time down here while the song is up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHa, ha!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came a cry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the old villain with his head on a jug! He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbeen having a little feast all to himself and his friend the captain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShake him! Wake him!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted the others impatiently.\\r\\n    Galion was not at all pleased at being shaken or wakened, and still less at\\r\\nbeing laughed at. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all late,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he grumbled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere am I waiting and waiting\\r\\ndown here, while you fellows drink and make merry and forget your tasks. Small\\r\\nwonder if I fall asleep from weariness!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall wonder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said they, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen the explanation stands close at hand in a\\r\\njug! Come give us a taste of your sleeping-draught before we fall to! No need to\\r\\nwake the turnkey yonder. He has had his share by the looks of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then they drank once round and became mighty merry all of a sudden. But\\r\\nthey did not quite lose their wits. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSave us, Galion!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried some, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou began\\r\\nyour feasting early and muddled your wits! You have stacked some full casks\\r\\nhere instead of the empty ones, if there is anything in weight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet on with the work!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled the butler. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is nothing in the feeling\\r\\nof weight in an idle toss-pot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arms. These are the ones to go and no others. Do\\r\\nas I say!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they answered rolling the barrels to the opening. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn\\r\\nyour head be it, if the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s full buttertubs and his best wine is pushed into the\\r\\nriver for the Lake-men to feast on for nothing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Roll\\xe2\\x80\\x94roll\\xe2\\x80\\x94roll\\xe2\\x80\\x94roll,\\r\\n       roll-roll-rolling down the hole!\\r\\n       Heave ho! Splash plump!\\r\\n       Down they go, down they bump!\\r\\n\\x0c    So they sang as first one barrel and then another rumbled to the dark opening\\r\\nand was pushed over into the cold water some feet below. Some were barrels\\r\\nreally empty, some were tubs neatly packed with a dwarf each; but down they all\\r\\nwent, one after another, with many a clash and a bump, thudding on top of ones\\r\\nbelow, smacking into the water, jostling against the walls of the tunnel, knocking\\r\\ninto one another, and bobbing away down the current.\\r\\n    It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in\\r\\nhis plan. Most likely you saw it some time ago and have been laughing at him;\\r\\nbut I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose you would have done half as well yourselves in his place. Of\\r\\ncourse he was not in a barrel himself, nor was there anyone to pack him in, even\\r\\nif there had been a chance! It looked as if he would certainly lose his friends this\\r\\ntime (nearly all of them had already disappeared through the dark trap-door), and\\r\\nget utterly left behind and have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf-\\r\\ncaves for ever. For even if he could have escaped through the upper gates at\\r\\nonce, he had precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves again. He did not\\r\\nknow the way by land to the place where the barrels were collected. He\\r\\nwondered what on earth would happen to them without him; for he had not had\\r\\ntime to tell the dwarves all that he had learned, or what he had meant to do, once\\r\\nthey were out of the wood.\\r\\n    While all these thoughts were passing through his mind, the elves being very\\r\\nmerry began to sing a song round the river-door. Some had already gone to haul\\r\\non the ropes which pulled up the portcullis at the water-gate so as to let out the\\r\\nbarrels as soon as they were all afloat below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Down the swift dark stream you go\\r\\n       Back to lands you once did know!\\r\\n       Leave the halls and caverns deep,\\r\\n       Leave the northern mountains steep,\\r\\n       Where the forest wide and dim\\r\\n       Stoops in shadow grey and grim!\\r\\n       Float beyond the world of trees\\r\\n       Out into the whispering breeze,\\r\\n       Past the rushes, past the reeds,\\r\\n       Past the marsh\\xe2\\x80\\x99s waving weeds,\\r\\n       Through the mist that riseth white\\r\\n       Up from mere and pool at night!\\r\\n\\x0c       Follow, follow stars that leap\\r\\n       Up the heavens cold and steep;\\r\\n       Turn when dawn comes over land,\\r\\n       Over rapid, over sand,\\r\\n       South away! and South away!\\r\\n       Seek the sunlight and the day,\\r\\n       Back to pasture, back to mead,\\r\\n       Where the kine and oxen feed!\\r\\n       Back to gardens on the hills\\r\\n       Where the berry swells and fills\\r\\n       Under sunlight, under day!\\r\\n       South away! and South away!\\r\\n       Down the swift dark stream you go\\r\\n       Back to lands you once did know!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n     Now the very last barrel was being rolled to the doors! In despair and not\\r\\nknowing what else to do, poor little Bilbo caught hold of it and was pushed over\\r\\nthe edge with it. Down into the water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water\\r\\nwith the barrel on top of him.\\r\\n     He came up again spluttering and clinging to the wood like a rat, but for all\\r\\nhis efforts he could not scramble on top. Every time he tried, the barrel rolled\\r\\nround and ducked him under again. It was really empty, and floated light as a\\r\\ncork. Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves still singing in\\r\\nthe cellar above. Then suddenly the trap-doors fell to with a boom and their\\r\\nvoices faded away. He was in the dark tunnel floating in icy water, all alone\\xe2\\x80\\x94for\\r\\nyou cannot count friends that are all packed up in barrels.\\r\\n     Very soon a grey patch came in the darkness ahead. He heard the creak of the\\r\\nwater-gate being hauled up, and he found that he was in the midst of a bobbing\\r\\nand bumping mass of casks and tubs all pressing together to pass under the arch\\r\\nand get out into the open stream. He had as much as he could do to prevent\\r\\nhimself from being hustled and battered to bits; but at last the jostling crowd\\r\\nbegan to break up and swing off, one by one, under the stony arch and away.\\r\\nThen he saw that it would have been no good even if he had managed to get\\r\\nastride his barrel, for there was no room to spare, not even for a hobbit, between\\r\\nits top and the suddenly stooping roof where the gate was.\\r\\n\\x0cOut they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank. Bilbo\\r\\nwondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting\\r\\ninto their tubs. Some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom seemed\\r\\npretty low in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves inside.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do hope I put the lids on tight enough!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought, but before long he was\\r\\nworrying too much about himself to remember the dwarves. He managed to keep\\r\\nhis head above the water, but he was shivering with the cold, and he wondered if\\r\\nhe would die of it before the luck turned, and how much longer he would be able\\r\\nto hang on, and whether he should risk the chance of letting go and trying to\\r\\nswim to the bank.\\r\\n    The luck turned all right before long: the eddying current carried several\\r\\nbarrels close ashore at one point and there for a while they stuck against some\\r\\nhidden root. Then Bilbo took the opportunity of scrambling up the side of his\\r\\nbarrel while it was held steady against another. Up he crawled like a drowned\\r\\nrat, and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could. The\\r\\nbreeze was cold but better than the water, and he hoped he would not suddenly\\r\\nroll off again when they started off once more.\\r\\n    Before long the barrels broke free again and turned and twisted off down the\\r\\nstream, and out into the main current. Then he found it quite as difficult to stick\\r\\non as he had feared; but he managed it somehow, though it was miserably\\r\\nuncomfortable. Luckily he was very light, and the barrel was a good big one and\\r\\nbeing rather leaky had now shipped a small amount of water. All the same it was\\r\\nlike trying to ride, without bridle or stirrups, a round-bellied pony that was\\r\\nalways thinking of rolling on the grass.\\r\\n    In this way at last Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand\\r\\ngrew thinner. He could see the paler sky between them. The dark river opened\\r\\nsuddenly wide, and there it was joined to the main water of the Forest River\\r\\nflowing down in haste from the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great doors. There was a dim sheet of\\r\\nwater no longer overshadowed, and on its sliding surface there were dancing and\\r\\nbroken reflections of clouds and of stars. Then the hurrying water of the Forest\\r\\nRiver swept all the company of casks and tubs away to the north bank, in which\\r\\nit had eaten out a wide bay. This had a shingly shore under hanging banks and\\r\\nwas walled at the eastern end by a little jutting cape of hard rock. On the shallow\\r\\nshore most of the barrels ran aground, though a few went on to bump against the\\r\\nstony pier.\\r\\n    There were people on the look-out on the banks. They quickly poled and\\r\\npushed all the barrels together into the shallows, and when they had counted\\r\\n\\x0cthem they roped them together and left them till the morning. Poor dwarves!\\r\\nBilbo was not badly off now. He slipped from his barrel and waded ashore, and\\r\\nthen sneaked along to some huts that he could see near the water\\xe2\\x80\\x99s edge. He no\\r\\nlonger thought twice about picking up a supper uninvited if he got the chance, he\\r\\nhad been obliged to do it for so long, and he knew now only too well what it was\\r\\nto be really hungry, not merely politely interested in the dainties of a well-filled\\r\\nlarder. Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees, and that appealed\\r\\nto him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night, for now we are\\r\\ndrawing near the end of the eastward journey and coming to the last and greatest\\r\\nadventure, so we must hurry on. Of course helped by his magic ring he got on\\r\\nvery well at first, but he was given away in the end by his wet footsteps and the\\r\\ntrail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat; and also he began to\\r\\nsnivel, and wherever he tried to hide he was found out by the terrific explosions\\r\\nof his suppressed sneezes. Very soon there was a fine commotion in the village\\r\\nby the riverside; but Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf and a leather\\r\\nbottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him. The rest of the night he had\\r\\nto pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but the bottle helped him to do that,\\r\\nand he actually dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was\\r\\ngetting late and the air was chilly.\\r\\n    He woke again with a specially loud sneeze. It was already grey morning,\\r\\nand there was a merry racket down by the river. They were making up a raft of\\r\\nbarrels, and the raft-elves would soon be steering it off down the stream to Lake-\\r\\ntown. Bilbo sneezed again. He was no longer dripping but he felt cold all over.\\r\\nHe scrambled down as fast as his stiff legs would take him and managed just in\\r\\ntime to get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle.\\r\\nLuckily there was no sun at the time to cast an awkward shadow, and for a mercy\\r\\nhe did not sneeze again for a good while.\\r\\n    There was a mighty pushing of poles. The elves that were standing in the\\r\\nshallow water heaved and shoved. The barrels now all lashed together creaked\\r\\nand fretted.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a heavy load!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d some grumbled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey float too deep\\xe2\\x80\\x94some of these\\r\\nare never empty. If they had come ashore in the daylight, we might have had a\\r\\nlook inside,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo time now!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the raftman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShove off!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And off they went at last,\\r\\n\\x0cslowly at first, until they had passed the point of rock where other elves stood to\\r\\nfend them off with poles, and then quicker and quicker as they caught the main\\r\\nstream and went sailing away down, down towards the Lake.\\r\\n    They had escaped the dungeons of the king and were through the wood, but\\r\\nwhether alive or dead still remains to be seen.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter X\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA WARM WELCOME\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day grew lighter and warmer as they floated along. After a while the river\\r\\nrounded a steep shoulder of land that came down upon their left. Under its rocky\\r\\nfeet like an inland cliff the deepest stream had flowed lapping and bubbling.\\r\\nSuddenly the cliff fell away. The shores sank. The trees ended. Then Bilbo saw a\\r\\nsight:\\r\\n    The lands opened wide about him, filled with the waters of the river which\\r\\nbroke up and wandered in a hundred winding courses, or halted in marshes and\\r\\npools dotted with isles on every side; but still a strong water flowed on steadily\\r\\nthrough the midst. And far away, its dark head in a torn cloud, there loomed the\\r\\nMountain! Its nearest neighbours to the North-East and the tumbled land that\\r\\njoined it to them could not be seen. All alone it rose and looked across the\\r\\nmarshes to the forest. The Lonely Mountain! Bilbo had come far and through\\r\\nmany adventures to see it, and now he did not like the look of it in the least.\\r\\n    As he listened to the talk of the raftmen and pieced together the scraps of\\r\\ninformation they let fall, he soon realized that he was very fortunate ever to have\\r\\nseen it at all, even from this distance. Dreary as had been his imprisonment and\\r\\nunpleasant as was his position (to say nothing of the poor dwarves underneath\\r\\nhim) still, he had been more lucky than he had guessed. The talk was all of the\\r\\ntrade that came and went on the waterways and the growth of the traffic on the\\r\\nriver, as the roads out of the East towards Mirkwood vanished or fell into disuse;\\r\\nand of the bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood-elves about the upkeep of\\r\\nthe Forest River and the care of the banks. Those lands had changed much since\\r\\nthe days when dwarves dwelt in the Mountain, days which most people now\\r\\nremembered only as a very shadowy tradition. They had changed even in recent\\r\\nyears, and since the last news that Gandalf had had of them. Great floods and\\r\\n\\x0crains had swollen the waters that flowed east; and there had been an earthquake\\r\\nor two (which some were inclined to attribute to the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x94alluding to him\\r\\nchiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in the direction of the Mountain). The\\r\\nmarshes and bogs had spread wider and wider on either side. Paths had vanished,\\r\\nand many a rider and wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost ways across.\\r\\nThe elf-road through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the advice of\\r\\nBeorn now came to a doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the\\r\\nforest; only the river offered any longer a safe way from the skirts of Mirkwood\\r\\nin the North to the mountain-shadowed plains beyond, and the river was guarded\\r\\nby the Wood-elves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 king.\\r\\n    So you see Bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good. It\\r\\nmight have been some comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had\\r\\nknown that news of this had reached Gandalf far away and given him great\\r\\nanxiety, and that he was in fact finishing his other business (which does not\\r\\ncome into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s company.\\r\\nBut Bilbo did not know it.\\r\\n    All he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and\\r\\nhe was hungry, and had a nasty cold in the nose, and did not like the way the\\r\\nMountain seemed to frown at him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer. After\\r\\na while, however, the river took a more southerly course and the Mountain\\r\\nreceded again, and at last, late in the day the shores grew rocky, the river\\r\\ngathered all its wandering waters together into a deep and rapid flood, and they\\r\\nswept along at great speed.\\r\\n    The sun had set when turning with another sweep towards the East the forest-\\r\\nriver rushed into the Long Lake. There it had a wide mouth with stony clifflike\\r\\ngates at either side whose feet were piled with shingles. The Long Lake! Bilbo\\r\\nhad never imagined that any water that was not the sea could look so big. It was\\r\\nso wide that the opposite shores looked small and far, but it was so long that its\\r\\nnortherly end, which pointed towards the Mountain, could not be seen at all.\\r\\nOnly from the map did Bilbo know that away up there, where the stars of the\\r\\nWain were already twinkling, the Running River came down into the lake from\\r\\nDale and with the Forest River filled with deep waters what must once have been\\r\\na great deep rocky valley. At the southern end the doubled waters poured out\\r\\nagain over high waterfalls and ran away hurriedly to unknown lands. In the still\\r\\nevening air the noise of the falls could be heard like a distant roar.\\r\\n    Not far from the mouth of the Forest River was the strange town he heard the\\r\\nelves speak of in the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cellars. It was not built on the shore, though there\\r\\n\\x0cwere a few huts and buildings there, but right out on the surface of the lake,\\r\\nprotected from the swirl of the entering river by a promontory of rock which\\r\\nformed a calm bay. A great bridge made of wood ran out to where on huge piles\\r\\nmade of forest trees was built a busy wooden town, not a town of elves but of\\r\\nMen, who still dared to dwell here under the shadow of the distant dragon-\\r\\nmountain. They still throve on the trade that came up the great river from the\\r\\nSouth and was carted past the falls to their town; but in the great days of old,\\r\\nwhen Dale in the North was rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and\\r\\npowerful, and there had been fleets of boats on the waters, and some were filled\\r\\nwith gold and some with warriors in armour, and there had been wars and deeds\\r\\nwhich were now only a legend. The rotting piles of a greater town could still be\\r\\nseen along the shores when the waters sank in a drought.\\r\\n   But men remembered little of all that, though some still sang old songs of the\\r\\ndwarf-kings of the Mountain, Thror and Thrain of the race of Durin, and of the\\r\\ncoming of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of Dale. Some sang too that Thror\\r\\nand Thrain would come back one day and gold would flow in rivers, through the\\r\\nmountain-gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new\\r\\nlaughter. But this pleasant legend did not much affect their daily business.\\r\\n\\x0cAs soon as the raft of barrels came in sight boats rowed out from the piles of the\\r\\ntown, and voices hailed the raft-steerers. Then ropes were cast and oars were\\r\\n\\x0cpulled, and soon the raft was drawn out of the current of the Forest River and\\r\\ntowed away round the high shoulder of rock into the little bay of Lake-town.\\r\\nThere it was moored not far from the shoreward head of the great bridge. Soon\\r\\nmen would come up from the South and take some of the casks away, and others\\r\\nthey would fill with goods they had brought to be taken back up the stream to the\\r\\nWood-elves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 home. In the meanwhile the barrels were left afloat while the elves\\r\\nof the raft and the boatmen went to feast in Lake-town.\\r\\n    They would have been surprised, if they could have seen what happened\\r\\ndown by the shore, after they had gone and the shades of night had fallen. First\\r\\nof all a barrel was cut loose by Bilbo and pushed to the shore and opened.\\r\\nGroans came from inside, and out crept a most unhappy dwarf. Wet straw was in\\r\\nhis draggled beard; he was so sore and stiff, so bruised and buffeted he could\\r\\nhardly stand or stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore.\\r\\nHe had a famished and a savage look like a dog that has been chained and\\r\\nforgotten in a kennel for a week. It was Thorin, but you could only have told it\\r\\nby his golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky-blue\\r\\nhood with its tarnished silver tassel. It was some time before he would be even\\r\\npolite to the hobbit.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, are you alive or are you dead?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo quite crossly. Perhaps he\\r\\nhad forgotten that he had had at least one good meal more than the dwarves, and\\r\\nalso the use of his arms and legs, not to speak of a greater allowance of air. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre\\r\\nyou still in prison, or are you free? If you want food, and if you want to go on\\r\\nwith this silly adventure\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s yours after all and not mine\\xe2\\x80\\x94you had better slap\\r\\nyour arms and rub your legs and try and help me get the others out while there is\\r\\na chance!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Thorin of course saw the sense of this, so after a few more groans he got up\\r\\nand helped the hobbit as well as he could. In the darkness floundering in the cold\\r\\nwater they had a difficult and very nasty job finding which were the right barrels.\\r\\nKnocking outside and calling only discovered about six dwarves that could\\r\\nanswer. These were unpacked and helped ashore where they sat or lay muttering\\r\\nand moaning; they were so soaked and bruised and cramped that they could\\r\\nhardly yet realize their release or be properly thankful for it.\\r\\n    Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy, and it was no good asking\\r\\nthem to help. Bifur and Bofur were less knocked about and drier, but they lay\\r\\ndown and would do nothing. Fili and Kili, however, who were young (for\\r\\ndwarves) and had also been packed more neatly with plenty of straw into smaller\\r\\ncasks, came out more or less smiling, with only a bruise or two and a stiffness\\r\\n\\x0cthat soon wore off.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope I never smell the smell of apples again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fili. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy tub was full\\r\\nof it. To smell apples everlastingly when you can scarcely move and are cold and\\r\\nsick with hunger is maddening. I could eat anything in the wide world now, for\\r\\nhours on end\\xe2\\x80\\x94but not an apple!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    With the willing help of Fili and Kili, Thorin and Bilbo at last discovered the\\r\\nremainder of the company and got them out. Poor fat Bombur was asleep or\\r\\nsenseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin were waterlogged and seemed only\\r\\nhalf alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless on the shore.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell! Here we are!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I suppose we ought to thank our stars\\r\\nand Mr. Baggins. I am sure he has a right to expect it, though I wish he could\\r\\nhave arranged a more comfortable journey. Still\\xe2\\x80\\x94all very much at your service\\r\\nonce more, Mr. Baggins. No doubt we shall feel properly grateful, when we are\\r\\nfed and recovered. In the meanwhile what next?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suggest Lake-town,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat else is there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Nothing else could, of course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and\\r\\nFili and Kili and the hobbit went along the shore to the great bridge. There were\\r\\nguards at the head of it, but they were not keeping very careful watch, for it was\\r\\nso long since there had been any real need. Except for occasional squabbles\\r\\nabout river-tolls they were friends with the Wood-elves. Other folk were far\\r\\naway; and some of the younger people in the town openly doubted the existence\\r\\nof any dragon in the mountain, and laughed at the greybeards and gammers who\\r\\nsaid that they had seen him flying in the sky in their young days. That being so it\\r\\nis not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut,\\r\\nand did not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the\\r\\nfour scouts. Their astonishment was enormous when Thorin Oakenshield\\r\\nstepped in through the door.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you and what do you want?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they shouted leaping to their feet and\\r\\ngroping for weapons.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the dwarf\\r\\nin a loud voice, and he looked it, in spite of his torn clothes and draggled hood.\\r\\nThe gold gleamed on his neck and waist; his eyes were dark and deep. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\ncome back. I wish to see the Master of your town!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then there was tremendous excitement. Some of the more foolish ran out of\\r\\nthe hut as if they expected the Mountain to go golden in the night and all the\\r\\nwaters of the lake turn yellow right away. The captain of the guard came\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd who are these?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked, pointing to Fili and Kili and Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe sons of my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Thorin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFili and Kili of the\\r\\nrace of Durin, and Mr. Baggins who has travelled with us out of the West.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you come in peace lay down your arms!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the captain.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have none,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, and it was true enough: their knives had been\\r\\ntaken from them by the wood-elves, and the great sword Orcrist too. Bilbo had\\r\\nhis short sword, hidden as usual, but he said nothing about that. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have no\\r\\nneed of weapons, who return at last to our own as spoken of old. Nor could we\\r\\nfight against so many. Take us to your master!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is at feast,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the captain.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen all the more reason for taking us to him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d burst in Fili, who was\\r\\ngetting impatient at these solemnities. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are worn and famished after our long\\r\\nroad and we have sick comrades. Now make haste and let us have no more\\r\\nwords, or your master may have something to say to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFollow me then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the captain, and with six men about them he led them\\r\\nover the bridge through the gates and into the market-place of the town. This\\r\\nwas a wide circle of quiet water surrounded by the tall piles on which were built\\r\\nthe greater houses, and by long wooden quays with many steps and ladders\\r\\ngoing down to the surface of the lake. From one great hall shone many lights and\\r\\nthere came the sound of many voices. They passed its doors and stood blinking\\r\\nin the light looking at long tables filled with folk.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain! I return!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\ncried Thorin in a loud voice from the door, before the captain could say\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n    All leaped to their feet. The Master of the town sprang from his great chair.\\r\\nBut none rose in greater surprise than the raft-men of the elves who were sitting\\r\\nat the lower end of the hall. Pressing forward before the Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s table they\\r\\ncried:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are prisoners of our king that have escaped, wandering vagabond\\r\\ndwarves that could not give any good account of themselves, sneaking through\\r\\nthe woods and molesting our people!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this true?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the Master. As a matter of fact he thought it far more\\r\\nlikely than the return of the King under the Mountain, if any such person had\\r\\never existed.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by the Elvenking and imprisoned\\r\\nwithout cause as we journeyed back to our own land,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut\\r\\nlock nor bar may hinder the homecoming spoken of old. Nor is this town in the\\r\\n\\x0cWood-elves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 realm. I speak to the Master of the town of the Men of the Lake, not\\r\\nto the raft-men of the king.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then the Master hesitated and looked from one to the other. The Elvenking\\r\\nwas very powerful in those parts and the Master wished for no enmity with him,\\r\\nnor did he think much of old songs, giving his mind to trade and tolls, to cargoes\\r\\nand gold, to which habit he owed his position. Others were of different mind,\\r\\nhowever, and quickly the matter was settled without him. The news had spread\\r\\nfrom the doors of the hall like fire through all the town. People were shouting\\r\\ninside the hall and outside it. The quays were thronged with hurrying feet. Some\\r\\nbegan to sing snatches of old songs concerning the return of the King under the\\r\\nMountain; that it was Thror\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grandson not Thror himself that had come back did\\r\\nnot bother them at all. Others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over\\r\\nthe lake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The King beneath the mountains,\\r\\n         The King of carven stone,\\r\\n       The lord of silver fountains\\r\\n         Shall come into his own!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       His crown shall be upholden,\\r\\n         His harp shall be restrung,\\r\\n       His halls shall echo golden\\r\\n         To songs of yore re-sung.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The woods shall wave on mountains\\r\\n         And grass beneath the sun;\\r\\n       His wealth shall flow in fountains\\r\\n         And the rivers golden run.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The streams shall run in gladness,\\r\\n         The lakes shall shine and burn,\\r\\n       All sorrow fail and sadness\\r\\n         At the Mountain-king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s return!\\r\\n\\x0c    So they sang, or very like that, only there was a great deal more of it, and\\r\\nthere was much shouting as well as the music of harps and of fiddles mixed up\\r\\nwith it. Indeed such excitement had not been known in the town in the memory\\r\\nof the oldest grandfather. The Wood-elves themselves began to wonder greatly\\r\\nand even to be afraid. They did not know of course how Thorin had escaped, and\\r\\nthey began to think their king might have made a serious mistake. As for the\\r\\nMaster he saw there was nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, for\\r\\nthe moment at any rate, and to pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said.\\r\\nSo he gave up to him his own great chair and set Fili and Kili beside him in\\r\\nplaces of honour. Even Bilbo was given a seat at the high table, and no\\r\\nexplanation of where he came in\\xe2\\x80\\x94no songs had alluded to him even in the\\r\\nobscurest way\\xe2\\x80\\x94was asked for in the general bustle.\\r\\n    Soon afterwards the other dwarves were brought into the town amid scenes of\\r\\nastonishing enthusiasm. They were all doctored and fed and housed and\\r\\npampered in the most delightful and satisfactory fashion. A large house was\\r\\ngiven up to Thorin and his company; boats and rowers were put at their service;\\r\\nand crowds sat outside and sang songs all day, or cheered if any dwarf showed\\r\\nso much as his nose.\\r\\n    Some of the songs were old ones; but some of them were quite new and\\r\\nspoke confidently of the sudden death of the dragon and of cargoes of rich\\r\\npresents coming down the river to Lake-town. These were inspired largely by the\\r\\nMaster and they did not particularly please the dwarves, but in the meantime\\r\\nthey were well contented and they quickly grew fat and strong again. Indeed\\r\\nwithin a week they were quite recovered, fitted out in fine cloth of their proper\\r\\ncolours, with beards combed and trimmed, and proud steps. Thorin looked and\\r\\nwalked as if his kingdom was already regained and Smaug chopped up into little\\r\\npieces.\\r\\n    Then, as he had said, the dwarves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 good feeling towards the little hobbit grew\\r\\nstronger every day. There were no more groans or grumbles. They drank his\\r\\nhealth, and they patted him on the back, and they made a great fuss of him;\\r\\nwhich was just as well, for he was not feeling particularly cheerful. He had not\\r\\nforgotten the look of the Mountain, nor the thought of the dragon, and he had\\r\\nbesides a shocking cold. For three days he sneezed and coughed, and he could\\r\\nnot go out, and even after that his speeches at banquets were limited to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThag\\r\\nyou very buch.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0cIn the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone back up the Forest River with their\\r\\ncargoes, and there was great excitement in the king\\xe2\\x80\\x99s palace. I have never heard\\r\\nwhat happened to the chief of the guards and the butler. Nothing of course was\\r\\never said about keys or barrels while the dwarves stayed in Lake-town, and\\r\\nBilbo was careful never to become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed\\r\\nthan was known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In\\r\\nany case the king knew now the dwarves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 errand, or thought he did, and he said\\r\\nto himself:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well! We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see! No treasure will come back through Mirkwood\\r\\nwithout my having something to say in the matter. But I expect they will all\\r\\ncome to a bad end, and serve them right!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He at any rate did not believe in\\r\\ndwarves fighting and killing dragons like Smaug, and he strongly suspected\\r\\nattempted burglary or something like it\\xe2\\x80\\x94which shows he was a wise elf and\\r\\nwiser than the men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end.\\r\\nHe sent out his spies about the shores of the lake and as far northward towards\\r\\nthe Mountain as they would go, and waited.\\r\\n    At the end of a fortnight Thorin began to think of departure. While the\\r\\nenthusiasm still lasted in the town was the time to get help. It would not do to let\\r\\neverything cool down with delay. So he spoke to the Master and his councillors\\r\\nand said that soon he and his company must go on towards the Mountain.\\r\\n    Then for the first time the Master was surprised and a little frightened; and he\\r\\nwondered if Thorin was after all really a descendant of the old kings. He had\\r\\nnever thought that the dwarves would actually dare to approach Smaug, but\\r\\nbelieved they were frauds who would sooner or later be discovered and be\\r\\nturned out. He was wrong. Thorin, of course, was really the grandson of the\\r\\nKing under the Mountain, and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare\\r\\nand do for revenge or the recovery of his own.\\r\\n    But the Master was not sorry at all to let them go. They were expensive to\\r\\nkeep, and their arrival had turned things into a long holiday in which business\\r\\nwas at a standstill. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet them go and bother Smaug, and see how he welcomes\\r\\nthem!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly, O Thorin Thrain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son Thror\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was what he\\r\\nsaid. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must claim your own. The hour is at hand, spoken of old. What help\\r\\nwe can offer shall be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is\\r\\nregained.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    So one day, although autumn was now getting far on, and winds were cold,\\r\\nand leaves were falling fast, three large boats left Lake-town, laden with rowers,\\r\\ndwarves, Mr. Baggins, and many provisions. Horses and ponies had been sent\\r\\n\\x0cround by circuitous paths to meet them at their appointed landing-place. The\\r\\nMaster and his councillors bade them farewell from the great steps of the town-\\r\\nhall that went down to the lake. People sang on the quays and out of windows.\\r\\nThe white oars dipped and splashed, and off they went north up the lake on the\\r\\nlast stage of their long journey. The only person thoroughly unhappy was Bilbo.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter XI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nON THE DOORSTEP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn two days going they rowed right up the Long Lake and passed out into the\\r\\nRiver Running, and now they could all see the Lonely Mountain towering grim\\r\\nand tall before them. The stream was strong and their going slow. At the end of\\r\\nthe third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or western bank\\r\\nand disembarked. Here they were joined by the horses with other provisions and\\r\\nnecessaries and the ponies for their own use that had been sent to meet them.\\r\\nThey packed what they could on the ponies and the rest was made into a store\\r\\nunder a tent, but none of the men of the town would stay with them even for the\\r\\nnight so near the shadow of the Mountain.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot at any rate until the songs have come true!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said they. It was easier to\\r\\nbelieve in the Dragon and less easy to believe in Thorin in these wild parts.\\r\\nIndeed their stores had no need of any guard, for all the land was desolate and\\r\\nempty. So their escort left them, making off swiftly down the river and the\\r\\nshoreward paths, although the night was already drawing on.\\r\\n    They spent a cold and lonely night and their spirits fell. The next day they set\\r\\nout again. Balin and Bilbo rode behind, each leading another pony heavily laden\\r\\nbeside him; the others were some way ahead picking out a slow road, for there\\r\\nwere no paths. They made north-west, slanting away from the River Running,\\r\\nand drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the Mountain that was\\r\\nflung out southwards towards them.\\r\\n    It was a weary journey, and a quiet and stealthy one. There was no laughter or\\r\\nsong or sound of harps, and the pride and hopes which had stirred in their hearts\\r\\nat the singing of old songs by the lake died away to a plodding gloom. They\\r\\nknew that they were drawing near to the end of their journey, and that it might be\\r\\na very horrible end. The land about them grew bleak and barren, though once, as\\r\\n\\x0cThorin told them, it had been green and fair. There was little grass, and before\\r\\nlong there was neither bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to\\r\\nspeak of ones long vanished. They were come to the Desolation of the Dragon,\\r\\nand they were come at the waning of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reached the skirts of the Mountain all the same without meeting any danger\\r\\nor any sign of the Dragon other than the wilderness he had made about his lair.\\r\\nThe Mountain lay dark and silent before them and ever higher above them. They\\r\\nmade their first camp on the western side of the great southern spur, which ended\\r\\nin a height called Ravenhill. On this there had been an old watch-post; but they\\r\\ndared not climb it yet, it was too exposed.\\r\\n    Before setting out to search the western spurs of the Mountain for the hidden\\r\\ndoor, on which all their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to\\r\\nspy out the land to the South where the Front Gate stood. For this purpose he\\r\\nchose Balin and Fili and Kili, and with them went Bilbo. They marched under\\r\\nthe grey and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding a\\r\\nwide loop over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the\\r\\nLake, flowing swift and noisily. Its bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep above\\r\\nthe stream; and gazing out from it over the narrow water, foaming and splashing\\r\\namong many boulders, they could see in the wide valley shadowed by the\\r\\nMountain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arms the grey ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere lies all that is left of Dale,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe mountain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sides were\\r\\ngreen with woods and all the sheltered valley rich and pleasant in the days when\\r\\nthe bells rang in that town.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He looked both sad and grim as he said this: he had\\r\\nbeen one of Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s companions on the day the Dragon came.\\r\\n    They did not dare to follow the river much further towards the Gate; but they\\r\\nwent on beyond the end of the southern spur, until lying hidden behind a rock\\r\\nthey could look out and see the dark cavernous opening in a great cliff-wall\\r\\nbetween the arms of the Mountain. Out of it the waters of the Running River\\r\\nsprang; and out of it too there came a steam and a dark smoke. Nothing moved\\r\\nin the waste, save the vapour and the water, and every now and again a black and\\r\\nominous crow. The only sound was the sound of the stony water, and every now\\r\\nand again the harsh croak of a bird. Balin shuddered.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us return!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can do no good here! And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like these\\r\\ndark birds, they look like spies of evil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0cThe Front Gate.\\r\\n\\x0c   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe dragon is still alive and in the halls under the Mountain then\\xe2\\x80\\x94or I\\r\\nimagine so from the smoke,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the hobbit.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat does not prove it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthough I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doubt you are right. But\\r\\nhe might be gone away some time, or he might be lying out on the mountain-side\\r\\nkeeping watch, and still I expect smokes and steams would come out of the\\r\\ngates: all the halls within must be filled with his foul reek.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by croaking crows above them, they\\r\\nmade their weary way back to the camp. Only in June they had been guests in\\r\\nthe fair house of Elrond, and though autumn was now crawling towards winter\\r\\nthat pleasant time now seemed years ago. They were alone in the perilous waste\\r\\nwithout hope of further help. They were at the end of their journey, but as far as\\r\\never, it seemed, from the end of their quest. None of them had much spirit left.\\r\\n    Now strange to say Mr. Baggins had more than the others. He would often\\r\\nborrow Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s map and gaze at it, pondering over the runes and the message of\\r\\nthe moon-letters Elrond had read. It was he that made the dwarves begin the\\r\\ndangerous search on the western slopes for the secret door. They moved their\\r\\ncamp then to a long valley, narrower than the great dale in the South where the\\r\\nGates of the river stood, and walled with lower spurs of the Mountain. Two of\\r\\nthese here thrust forward west from the main mass in long steep-sided ridges that\\r\\nfell ever downwards towards the plain. On this western side there were fewer\\r\\nsigns of the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marauding feet, and there was some grass for their ponies.\\r\\nFrom this western camp, shadowed all day by cliff and wall until the sun began\\r\\nto sink towards the forest, day by day they toiled in parties searching for paths\\r\\nup the mountain-side. If the map was true, somewhere high above the cliff at the\\r\\nvalley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head must stand the secret door. Day by day they came back to their\\r\\ncamp without success.\\r\\n    But at last unexpectedly they found what they were seeking. Fili and Kili and\\r\\nthe hobbit went back one day down the valley and scrambled among the tumbled\\r\\nrocks at its southern corner. About midday, creeping behind a great stone that\\r\\nstood alone like a pillar, Bilbo came on what looked like rough steps going\\r\\nupwards. Following these excitedly he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow\\r\\ntrack, often lost, often rediscovered, that wandered on to the top of the southern\\r\\nridge and brought them at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north\\r\\nacross the face of the Mountain. Looking down they saw that they were at the\\r\\ntop of the cliff at the valley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head and were gazing down on to their own camp\\r\\n\\x0cbelow. Silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their right, they went in single file\\r\\nalong the ledge, till the wall opened and they turned into a little steep-walled\\r\\nbay, grassy-floored, still and quiet. Its entrance which they had found could not\\r\\nbe seen from below because of the overhang of the cliff, nor from further off\\r\\nbecause it was so small that it looked like a dark crack and no more. It was not a\\r\\ncave and was open to the sky above; but at its inner end a flat wall rose up that in\\r\\nthe lower part, close to the ground, was as smooth and upright as masons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 work,\\r\\nbut without a joint or crevice to be seen. No sign was there of post or lintel or\\r\\nthreshold, nor any sign of bar or bolt or key-hole; yet they did not doubt that\\r\\nthey had found the door at last.\\r\\n    They beat on it, they thrust and pushed at it, they implored it to move, they\\r\\nspoke fragments of broken spells of opening, and nothing stirred. At last tired\\r\\nout they rested on the grass at its feet, and then at evening began their long climb\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was excitement in the camp that night. In the morning they prepared to\\r\\nmove once more. Only Bofur and Bombur were left behind to guard the ponies\\r\\nand such stores as they had brought with them from the river. The others went\\r\\ndown the valley and up the newly found path, and so to the narrow ledge. Along\\r\\nthis they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow and breathless was it, with a\\r\\nfall of a hundred and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks below; but each of\\r\\nthem took a good coil of rope wound tight about his waist, and so at last without\\r\\nmishap they reached the little grassy bay.\\r\\n    There they made their third camp, hauling up what they needed from below\\r\\nwith their ropes. Down the same way they were able occasionally to lower one\\r\\nof the more active dwarves, such as Kili, to exchange such news as there was, or\\r\\nto take a share in the guard below, while Bofur was hauled up to the higher\\r\\ncamp. Bombur would not come up either the rope or the path.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am too fat for such fly-walks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should turn dizzy and tread on\\r\\nmy beard, and then you would be thirteen again. And the knotted ropes are too\\r\\nslender for my weight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meanwhile some of them explored the ledge beyond the opening and\\r\\nfound a path that led higher and higher on to the mountain; but they did not dare\\r\\n\\x0cto venture very far that way, nor was there much use in it. Out up there a silence\\r\\nreigned, broken by no bird or sound except that of the wind in the crannies of\\r\\nstone. They spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every\\r\\nrock. The others who were busy with the secret of the door had no more success.\\r\\nThey were too eager to trouble about the runes or the moon-letters, but tried\\r\\nwithout resting to discover where exactly in the smooth face of the rock the door\\r\\nwas hidden. They had brought picks and tools of many sorts from Lake-town,\\r\\nand at first they tried to use these. But when they struck the stone the handles\\r\\nsplintered and jarred their arms cruelly, and the steel heads broke or bent like\\r\\nlead. Mining work, they saw clearly, was no good against the magic that had\\r\\nshut this door; and they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise.\\r\\n    Bilbo found sitting on the doorstep lonesome and wearisome\\xe2\\x80\\x94there was not\\r\\na doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call the little grassy space between\\r\\nthe wall and the opening the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoorstep\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in fun, remembering Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words long\\r\\nago at the unexpected party in his hobbit-hole, when he said they could sit on the\\r\\ndoorstep till they thought of something. And sit and think they did, or wandered\\r\\naimlessly about, and glummer and glummer they became.\\r\\n    Their spirits had risen a little at the discovery of the path, but now they sank\\r\\ninto their boots; and yet they would not give it up and go away. The hobbit was\\r\\nno longer much brighter than the dwarves. He would do nothing but sit with his\\r\\nback to the rock-face and stare away west through the opening, over the cliff,\\r\\nover the wide lands to the black wall of Mirkwood, and to the distances beyond,\\r\\nin which he sometimes thought he could catch glimpses of the Misty Mountains\\r\\nsmall and far. If the dwarves asked him what he was doing he answered:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou said sitting on the doorstep and thinking would be my job, not to\\r\\nmention getting inside, so I am sitting and thinking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But I am afraid he was not\\r\\nthinking much of the job, but of what lay beyond the blue distance, the quiet\\r\\nWestern Land and the Hill and his hobbit-hole under it.\\r\\n    A large grey stone lay in the centre of the grass and he stared moodily at it or\\r\\nwatched the great snails. They seemed to love the little shut-in bay with its walls\\r\\nof cool rock, and there were many of them of huge size crawling slowly and\\r\\nstickily along its sides.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTomorrow begins the last week of autumn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin one day.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd winter comes after autumn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bifur.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd next year after that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dwalin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand our beards will grow till they\\r\\n\\x0chang down the cliff to the valley before anything happens here. What is our\\r\\nburglar doing for us? Since he has got an invisible ring, and ought to be a\\r\\nspecially excellent performer now, I am beginning to think he might go through\\r\\nthe Front Gate and spy things out a bit!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Bilbo heard this\\xe2\\x80\\x94the dwarves were on the rocks just above the enclosure\\r\\nwhere he was sitting\\xe2\\x80\\x94and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood Gracious!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso that is what they\\r\\nare beginning to think, is it? It is always poor me that has to get them out of their\\r\\ndifficulties, at least since the wizard left. Whatever am I going to do? I might\\r\\nhave known that something dreadful would happen to me in the end. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nthink I could bear to see the unhappy valley of Dale again, and as for that\\r\\nsteaming gate! ! !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    That night he was very miserable and hardly slept. Next day the dwarves all\\r\\nwent wandering off in various directions; some were exercising the ponies down\\r\\nbelow, some were roving about the mountain-side. All day Bilbo sat gloomily in\\r\\nthe grassy bay gazing at the stone, or out west through the narrow opening. He\\r\\nhad a queer feeling that he was waiting for something. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps the wizard will\\r\\nsuddenly come back today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought.\\r\\n    If he lifted his head he could see a glimpse of the distant forest. As the sun\\r\\nturned west there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as if the light caught\\r\\nthe last pale leaves. Soon he saw the orange ball of the sun sinking towards the\\r\\nlevel of his eyes. He went to the opening and there pale and faint was a thin new\\r\\nmoon above the rim of Earth.\\r\\n    At that very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him. There on the grey\\r\\nstone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale yellow\\r\\nbreast freckled with dark spots. Crack! It had caught a snail and was knocking it\\r\\non the stone. Crack! Crack!\\r\\n    Suddenly Bilbo understood. Forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge and\\r\\nhailed the dwarves, shouting and waving. Those that were nearest came\\r\\ntumbling over the rocks and as fast as they could along the ledge to him,\\r\\nwondering what on earth was the matter; the others shouted to be hauled up the\\r\\nropes (except Bombur, of course: he was asleep).\\r\\n    Quickly Bilbo explained. They all fell silent: the hobbit standing by the grey\\r\\nstone, and the dwarves with wagging beards watching impatiently. The sun sank\\r\\nlower and lower, and their hopes fell. It sank into a belt of reddened cloud and\\r\\ndisappeared. The dwarves groaned, but still Bilbo stood almost without moving.\\r\\nThe little moon was dipping to the horizon. Evening was coming on. Then\\r\\nsuddenly when their hope was lowest a red ray of the sun escaped like a finger\\r\\n\\x0cthrough a rent in the cloud. A gleam of light came straight through the opening\\r\\ninto the bay and fell on the smooth rock-face. The old thrush, who had been\\r\\nwatching from a high perch with beady eyes and head cocked on one side, gave\\r\\na sudden trill. There was a loud crack. A flake of rock split from the wall and\\r\\nfell. A hole appeared suddenly about three feet from the ground.\\r\\n    Quickly, trembling lest the chance should fade, the dwarves rushed to the\\r\\nrock and pushed\\xe2\\x80\\x94in vain.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe key! The key!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is Thorin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Thorin hurried up.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe key!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe key that went with the map! Try it now while\\r\\nthere is still time!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then Thorin stepped up and drew the key on its chain from round his neck.\\r\\nHe put it to the hole. It fitted and it turned! Snap! The gleam went out, the sun\\r\\nsank, the moon was gone, and evening sprang into the sky.\\r\\n    Now they all pushed together, and slowly a part of the rock-wall gave way.\\r\\nLong straight cracks appeared and widened. A door five feet high and three\\r\\nbroad was outlined, and slowly without a sound swung inwards. It seemed as if\\r\\ndarkness flowed out like a vapour from the hole in the mountain-side, and deep\\r\\ndarkness in which nothing could be seen lay before their eyes, a yawning mouth\\r\\nleading in and down.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter XII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINSIDE INFORMATION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time the dwarves stood in the dark before the door and debated, until\\r\\nat last Thorin spoke:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow is the time for our esteemed Mr. Baggins, who has proved himself a\\r\\ngood companion on our long road, and a hobbit full of courage and resource far\\r\\nexceeding his size, and if I may say so possessed of good luck far exceeding the\\r\\nusual allowance\\xe2\\x80\\x94now is the time for him to perform the service for which he\\r\\nwas included in our Company; now is the time for him to earn his Reward.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    You are familiar with Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s style on important occasions, so I will not give\\r\\nyou any more of it, though he went on a good deal longer than this. It certainly\\r\\nwas an important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite\\r\\nfamiliar with Thorin too, and he knew what he was driving at.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first, O\\r\\nThorin Thrain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said\\r\\ncrossly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csay so at once and have done! I might refuse. I have got you out of two\\r\\nmesses already, which were hardly in the original bargain, so that I am, I think,\\r\\nalready owed some reward. But \\xe2\\x80\\x98third time pays for all\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as my father used to say,\\r\\nand somehow I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I shall refuse. Perhaps I have begun to trust my luck\\r\\nmore than I used to in the old days\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94he meant last spring before he left his own\\r\\nhouse, but it seemed centuries ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut anyway I think I will go and have a\\r\\npeep at once and get it over. Now who is coming with me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    He did not expect a chorus of volunteers, so he was not disappointed. Fili and\\r\\nKili looked uncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the others made no pretence\\r\\nof offering\\xe2\\x80\\x94except old Balin, the lookout man, who was rather fond of the\\r\\nhobbit. He said he would come inside at least and perhaps a bit of the way too,\\r\\nready to call for help if necessary.\\r\\n\\x0c    The most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay Bilbo\\r\\nreally handsomely for his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for\\r\\nthem, and they did not mind the poor little fellow doing it if he would; but they\\r\\nwould all have done their best to get him out of trouble, if he got into it, as they\\r\\ndid in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had\\r\\nany particular reasons for being grateful to him. There it is: dwarves are not\\r\\nheroes, but calculating folk with a great idea of the value of money; some are\\r\\ntricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are not, but are decent enough\\r\\npeople like Thorin and Company, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect too much.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the\\r\\nhobbit crept through the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far\\r\\neasier going than he expected. This was no goblin entrance, or rough wood-\\r\\nelves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cave. It was a passage made by dwarves, at the height of their wealth and\\r\\nskill: straight as a ruler, smooth-floored and smooth-sided, going with a gentle\\r\\nnever-varying slope direct\\xe2\\x80\\x94to some distant end in the blackness below.\\r\\n    After a while Balin bade Bilbo \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood luck!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and stopped where he could still\\r\\nsee the faint outline of the door, and by a trick of the echoes of the tunnel hear\\r\\nthe rustle of the whispering voices of the others just outside. Then the hobbit\\r\\nslipped on his ring, and warned by the echoes to take more than hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s care to\\r\\nmake no sound, he crept noiselessly down, down, down into the dark. He was\\r\\ntrembling with fear, but his little face was set and grim. Already he was a very\\r\\ndifferent hobbit from the one that had run out without a pocket-handkerchief\\r\\nfrom Bag-End long ago. He had not had a pocket-handkerchief for ages. He\\r\\nloosened his dagger in its sheath, tightened his belt, and went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow you are in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou went and\\r\\nput your foot right in it that night of the party, and now you have got to pull it\\r\\nout and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool I was and am!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the least Tookish\\r\\npart of him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have absolutely no use for dragon-guarded treasures, and the\\r\\nwhole lot could stay here for ever, if only I could wake up and find this beastly\\r\\ntunnel was my own front-hall at home!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   He did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the door\\r\\nbehind had faded away. He was altogether alone. Soon he thought it was\\r\\n\\x0cbeginning to feel warm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that a kind of a glow I seem to see coming right\\r\\nahead down there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought.\\r\\n     It was. As he went forward it grew and grew, till there was no doubt about it.\\r\\nIt was a red light steadily getting redder and redder. Also it was now\\r\\nundoubtedly hot in the tunnel. Wisps of vapour floated up and past him and he\\r\\nbegan to sweat. A sound, too, began to throb in his ears, a sort of bubbling like\\r\\nthe noise of a large pot galloping on the fire, mixed with a rumble as of a\\r\\ngigantic tom-cat purring. This grew to the unmistakable gurgling noise of some\\r\\nvast animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red glow in front of him.\\r\\n     It was at this point that Bilbo stopped. Going on from there was the bravest\\r\\nthing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterwards were as\\r\\nnothing compared to it. He fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before he\\r\\never saw the vast danger that lay in wait. At any rate after a short halt go on he\\r\\ndid; and you can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, an opening of\\r\\nmuch the same size and shape as the door above. Through it peeps the hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlittle head. Before him lies the great bottom-most cellar or dungeon-hall of the\\r\\nancient dwarves right at the Mountain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s root. It is almost dark so that its vastness\\r\\ncan only be dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor there\\r\\nis a great glow. The glow of Smaug!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep; a thrumming came from his\\r\\njaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were low in slumber.\\r\\nBeneath him, under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all\\r\\nsides stretching away across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of precious\\r\\nthings, gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in\\r\\nthe ruddy light.\\r\\n    Smaug lay, with wings folded like an immeasurable bat, turned partly on one\\r\\nside, so that the hobbit could see his underparts and his long pale belly crusted\\r\\nwith gems and fragments of gold from his long lying on his costly bed. Behind\\r\\nhim where the walls were nearest could dimly be seen coats of mail, helms and\\r\\naxes, swords and spears hanging; and there in rows stood great jars and vessels\\r\\nfilled with a wealth that could not be guessed.\\r\\n    To say that Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breath was taken away is no description at all. There are\\r\\nno words left to express his staggerment, since Men changed the language that\\r\\nthey learned of elves in the days when all the world was wonderful. Bilbo had\\r\\nheard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory\\r\\n\\x0cof such treasure had never yet come home to him. His heart was filled and\\r\\npierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and he gazed\\r\\nmotionless, almost forgetting the frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and\\r\\ncount.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he stole\\r\\nfrom the shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of the\\r\\nmounds of treasure. Above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in\\r\\nhis sleep. He grasped a great two-handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and\\r\\ncast one fearful eye upwards. Smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, the rumble of\\r\\nhis snoring changed its note.\\r\\n    Then Bilbo fled. But the dragon did not wake\\xe2\\x80\\x94not yet\\xe2\\x80\\x94but shifted into\\r\\nother dreams of greed and violence, lying there in his stolen hall while the little\\r\\nhobbit toiled back up the long tunnel. His heart was beating and a more fevered\\r\\nshaking was in his legs than when he was going down, but still he clutched the\\r\\ncup, and his chief thought was: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it! This will show them. \\xe2\\x80\\x98More like a\\r\\ngrocer than a burglar\\xe2\\x80\\x99 indeed! Well, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hear no more of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as\\r\\nhe was surprised. He picked Bilbo up and carried him out into the open air. It\\r\\nwas midnight and clouds had covered the stars, but Bilbo lay with his eyes shut,\\r\\ngasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing\\r\\nthe excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised him and patted him on the\\r\\nback and put themselves and all their families for generations to come at his\\r\\nservice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking\\r\\ndelightedly of the recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling\\r\\nwoke in the mountain underneath as if it was an old volcano that had made up its\\r\\nmind to start eruptions once again. The door behind them was pulled nearly to,\\r\\nand blocked from closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful\\r\\nechoes, from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made\\r\\nthe ground beneath them tremble.\\r\\n    Then the dwarves forgot their joy and their confident boasts of a moment\\r\\nbefore and cowered down in fright. Smaug was still to be reckoned with. It does\\r\\n\\x0cnot do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him.\\r\\nDragons may not have much real use for all their wealth, but they know it to an\\r\\nounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception.\\r\\nHe had passed from an uneasy dream (in which a warrior, altogether\\r\\ninsignificant in size but provided with a bitter sword and great courage, figured\\r\\nmost unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to wide waking. There was a\\r\\nbreath of strange air in his cave. Could there be a draught from that little hole?\\r\\nHe had never felt quite happy about it, though it was so small, and now he glared\\r\\nat it in suspicion and wondered why he had never blocked it up. Of late he had\\r\\nhalf fancied he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above\\r\\nthat came down through it to his lair. He stirred and stretched forth his neck to\\r\\nsniff. Then he missed the cup!\\r\\n     Thieves! Fire! Murder! Such a thing had not happened since first he came to\\r\\nthe Mountain! His rage passes description\\xe2\\x80\\x94the sort of rage that is only seen\\r\\nwhen rich folk that have more than they can enjoy suddenly lose something that\\r\\nthey have long had but have never before used or wanted. His fire belched forth,\\r\\nthe hall smoked, he shook the mountain-roots. He thrust his head in vain at the\\r\\nlittle hole, and then coiling his length together, roaring like thunder underground,\\r\\nhe sped from his deep lair through its great door, out into the huge passages of\\r\\nthe mountain-palace and up towards the Front Gate.\\r\\n     To hunt the whole mountain till he had caught the thief and had torn and\\r\\ntrampled him was his one thought. He issued from the Gate, the waters rose in\\r\\nfierce whistling steam, and up he soared blazing into the air and settled on the\\r\\nmountain-top in a spout of green and scarlet flame. The dwarves heard the awful\\r\\nrumour of his flight, and they crouched against the walls of the grassy terrace\\r\\ncringing under boulders, hoping somehow to escape the frightful eyes of the\\r\\nhunting dragon.\\r\\n     There they would have all been killed, if it had not been for Bilbo once again.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuick! Quick!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he gasped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe door! The tunnel! It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no good here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     Roused by these words they were just about to creep inside the tunnel when\\r\\nBifur gave a cry: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy cousins! Bombur and Bofur\\xe2\\x80\\x94we have forgotten them,\\r\\nthey are down in the valley!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey will be slain, and all our ponies too, and all our stores lost,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moaned\\r\\nthe others. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can do nothing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNonsense!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, recovering his dignity. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe cannot leave them. Get\\r\\ninside Mr. Baggins and Balin, and you two Fili and Kili\\xe2\\x80\\x94the dragon shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have\\r\\nall of us. Now you others, where are the ropes? Be quick!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    Those were perhaps the worst moments they had been through yet. The\\r\\nhorrible sounds of Smaug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anger were echoing in the stony hollows far above;\\r\\nat any moment he might come blazing down or fly whirling round and find them\\r\\nthere, near the perilous cliff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s edge hauling madly on the ropes. Up came Bofur,\\r\\nand still all was safe. Up came Bombur, puffing and blowing while the ropes\\r\\ncreaked, and still all was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of stores, and\\r\\nthen danger was upon them.\\r\\n    A whirring noise was heard. A red light touched the points of standing rocks.\\r\\nThe dragon came.\\r\\n    They had barely time to fly back to the tunnel, pulling and dragging in their\\r\\nbundles, when Smaug came hurtling from the North, licking the mountain-sides\\r\\nwith flame, beating his great wings with a noise like a roaring wind. His hot\\r\\nbreath shrivelled the grass before the door, and drove in through the crack they\\r\\nhad left and scorched them as they lay hid. Flickering fires leaped up and black\\r\\nrock-shadows danced. Then darkness fell as he passed again. The ponies\\r\\nscreamed with terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. The dragon\\r\\nswooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be the end of our poor beasts!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing can escape\\r\\nSmaug once he sees it. Here we are and here we shall have to stay, unless any\\r\\none fancies tramping the long open miles back to the river with Smaug on the\\r\\nwatch!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    It was not a pleasant thought! They crept further down the tunnel, and there\\r\\nthey lay and shivered though it was warm and stuffy, until dawn came pale\\r\\nthrough the crack of the door. Every now and again through the night they could\\r\\nhear the roar of the flying dragon grow and then pass and fade, as he hunted\\r\\nround and round the mountain-sides.\\r\\n    He guessed from the ponies, and from the traces of the camps he had\\r\\ndiscovered, that men had come up from the river and the lake and had scaled the\\r\\nmountain-side from the valley where the ponies had been standing; but the door\\r\\nwithstood his searching eye, and the little high-walled bay had kept out his\\r\\nfiercest flames. Long he had hunted in vain till the dawn chilled his wrath and he\\r\\nwent back to his golden couch to sleep\\xe2\\x80\\x94and to gather new strength. He would\\r\\nnot forget or forgive the theft, not if a thousand years turned him to smouldering\\r\\nstone, but he could afford to wait. Slow and silent he crept back to his lair and\\r\\nhalf closed his eyes.\\r\\n    When morning came the terror of the dwarves grew less. They realized that\\r\\ndangers of this kind were inevitable in dealing with such a guardian, and that it\\r\\n\\x0cwas no good giving up their quest yet. Nor could they get away just now, as\\r\\nThorin had pointed out. Their ponies were lost or killed, and they would have to\\r\\nwait some time before Smaug relaxed his watch sufficiently for them to dare the\\r\\nlong way on foot. Luckily they had saved enough of their stores to last them still\\r\\nfor some time.\\r\\n    They debated long on what was to be done, but they could think of no way of\\r\\ngetting rid of Smaug\\xe2\\x80\\x94which had always been a weak point in their plans, as\\r\\nBilbo felt inclined to point out. Then as is the nature of folk that are thoroughly\\r\\nperplexed, they began to grumble at the hobbit, blaming him for what had at first\\r\\nso pleased them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrath so soon.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat else do you suppose a burglar is to do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo angrily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was\\r\\nnot engaged to kill dragons, that is warrior\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work, but to steal treasure. I made\\r\\nthe best beginning I could. Did you expect me to trot back with the whole hoard\\r\\nof Thror on my back? If there is any grumbling to be done, I think I might have a\\r\\nsay. You ought to have brought five hundred burglars not one. I am sure it\\r\\nreflects great credit on your grandfather, but you cannot pretend that you ever\\r\\nmade the vast extent of his wealth clear to me. I should want hundreds of years\\r\\nto bring it all up, if I was fifty times as big, and Smaug as tame as a rabbit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    After that of course the dwarves begged his pardon. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat then do you\\r\\npropose we should do, Mr. Baggins?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Thorin politely.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have no idea at the moment\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you mean about removing the treasure.\\r\\nThat obviously depends entirely on some new turn of luck and the getting rid of\\r\\nSmaug. Getting rid of dragons is not at all in my line, but I will do my best to\\r\\nthink about it. Personally I have no hopes at all, and wish I was safe back at\\r\\nhome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever mind that for the moment! What are we to do now, to-day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, if you really want my advice, I should say we can do nothing but stay\\r\\nwhere we are. By day we can no doubt creep out safely enough to take the air.\\r\\nPerhaps before long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by the\\r\\nriver and replenish our supplies. But in the meanwhile everyone ought to be well\\r\\ninside the tunnel by night.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I will make you an offer. I have got my ring and will creep down this\\r\\nvery noon\\xe2\\x80\\x94then if ever Smaug ought to be napping\\xe2\\x80\\x94and see what he is up to.\\r\\nPerhaps something will turn up. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Every worm has his weak spot,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as my father\\r\\nused to say, though I am sure it was not from personal experience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Naturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly. Already they had come to\\r\\nrespect little Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in their adventure. He\\r\\n\\x0chad begun to have ideas and plans of his own. When midday came he got ready\\r\\nfor another journey down into the Mountain. He did not like it of course, but it\\r\\nwas not so bad now he knew, more or less, what was in front of him. Had he\\r\\nknown more about dragons and their wily ways, he might have been more\\r\\nfrightened and less hopeful of catching this one napping.\\r\\n    The sun was shining when he started, but it was as dark as night in the tunnel.\\r\\nThe light from the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went down. So silent\\r\\nwas his going that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have surpassed it, and he\\r\\nwas inclined to feel a bit proud of himself as he drew near the lower door. There\\r\\nwas only the very faintest glow to be seen.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld Smaug is weary and asleep,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see me and he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nhear me. Cheer up Bilbo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He had forgotten or had never heard about dragons\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nsense of smell. It is also an awkward fact that they can keep half an eye open\\r\\nwatching while they sleep, if they are suspicious.\\r\\n    Smaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost dead and dark, with scarcely a\\r\\nsnore more than a whiff of unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped once more from\\r\\nthe entrance. He was just about to step out on to the floor when he caught a\\r\\nsudden thin and piercing ray of red from under the drooping lid of Smaug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left\\r\\neye. He was only pretending to sleep! He was watching the tunnel entrance!\\r\\nHurriedly Bilbo stepped back and blessed the luck of his ring. Then Smaug\\r\\nspoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along!\\r\\nHelp yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    But Bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as all that, and if Smaug\\r\\nhoped to get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo thank you,\\r\\nO Smaug the Tremendous!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did not come for presents. I only\\r\\nwished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great as tales say. I did\\r\\nnot believe them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the dragon somewhat flattered, even though he did not\\r\\nbelieve a word of it.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTruly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, O Smaug the Chiefest\\r\\nand Greatest of Calamities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have nice manners for a thief and a liar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the dragon. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou seem\\r\\nfamiliar with my name, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to remember smelling you before. Who\\r\\nare you and where do you come from, may I ask?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may indeed! I come from under the hill, and under the hills and over the\\r\\nhills my paths led. And through the air. I am he that walks unseen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo I can well believe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smaug, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut that is hardly your usual name.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I was chosen for the\\r\\nlucky number.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLovely titles!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered the dragon. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut lucky numbers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t always come\\r\\noff.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive\\r\\nagain from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sound so creditable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d scoffed Smaug.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the friend of bears and the guest of eagles. I am Ringwinner and\\r\\nLuckwearer; and I am Barrel-rider,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d went on Bilbo beginning to be pleased with\\r\\nhis riddling.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smaug. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let your imagination run away with\\r\\nyou!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis of course is the way to talk to dragons, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to reveal your\\r\\nproper name (which is wise), and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to infuriate them by a flat refusal\\r\\n(which is also very wise). No dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk\\r\\nand of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot here which Smaug\\r\\ndid not understand at all (though I expect you do, since you know all about\\r\\nBilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s adventures to which he was referring), but he thought he understood\\r\\nenough, and he chuckled in his wicked inside.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought so last night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he smiled to himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLake-men, some nasty\\r\\nscheme of those miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a lizard. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been\\r\\ndown that way for an age and an age; but I will soon alter that!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well, O Barrel-rider!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said aloud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMaybe Barrel was your pony\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nname; and maybe not, though it was fat enough. You may walk unseen, but you\\r\\ndid not walk all the way. Let me tell you I ate six ponies last night and I shall\\r\\ncatch and eat all the others before long. In return for the excellent meal I will\\r\\ngive you one piece of advice for your good: don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have more to do with dwarves\\r\\nthan you can help!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDwarves!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo in pretended surprise.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk to me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smaug. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know the smell (and taste) of dwarf\\xe2\\x80\\x94no\\r\\none better. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell me that I can eat a dwarf-ridden pony and not know it!\\r\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come to a bad end, if you go with such friends, Thief Barrel-rider. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\n\\x0cmind if you go back and tell them so from me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But he did not tell Bilbo that\\r\\nthere was one smell he could not make out at all, hobbit-smell; it was quite\\r\\noutside his experience and puzzled him mightily.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose you got a fair price for that cup last night?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome\\r\\nnow, did you? Nothing at all! Well, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just like them. And I suppose they are\\r\\nskulking outside, and your job is to do all the dangerous work and get what you\\r\\ncan when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not looking\\xe2\\x80\\x94for them? And you will get a fair share? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\nbelieve it! If you get off alive, you will be lucky.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBilbo was now beginning to feel really uncomfortable. Whenever Smaug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nroving eye, seeking for him in the shadows, flashed across him, he trembled, and\\r\\nan unaccountable desire seized hold of him to rush out and reveal himself and\\r\\ntell all the truth to Smaug. In fact he was in grievous danger of coming under the\\r\\ndragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke again.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know everything, O Smaug the Mighty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot gold alone\\r\\nbrought us hither.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHa! Ha! You admit the \\xe2\\x80\\x98us\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d laughed Smaug. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy not say \\xe2\\x80\\x98us fourteen\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nand be done with it, Mr. Lucky Number? I am pleased to hear that you had other\\r\\nbusiness in these parts besides my gold. In that case you may, perhaps, not\\r\\naltogether waste your time.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it has occurred to you that, even if you could steal the gold\\r\\nbit by bit\\xe2\\x80\\x94a matter of a hundred years or so\\xe2\\x80\\x94you could not get it very far? Not\\r\\nmuch use on the mountain-side? Not much use in the forest? Bless me! Had you\\r\\nnever thought of the catch? A fourteenth share, I suppose, or something like it,\\r\\nthose were the terms, eh? But what about delivery? What about cartage? What\\r\\nabout armed guards and tolls?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And Smaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and\\r\\na wily heart, and he knew his guesses were not far out, though he suspected that\\r\\nthe Lake-men were at the back of the plans, and that most of the plunder was\\r\\nmeant to stop there in the town by the shore that in his young days had been\\r\\ncalled Esgaroth.\\r\\n    You will hardly believe it, but poor Bilbo was really very taken aback. So far\\r\\nall his thoughts and energies had been concentrated on getting to the Mountain\\r\\nand finding the entrance. He had never bothered to wonder how the treasure was\\r\\nto be removed, certainly never how any part of it that might fall to his share was\\r\\nto be brought back all the way to Bag-End Under-Hill.\\r\\n    Now a nasty suspicion began to grow in his mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94had the dwarves forgotten\\r\\n\\x0cthis important point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the\\r\\ntime? That is the effect that dragon-talk has on the inexperienced. Bilbo of\\r\\ncourse ought to have been on his guard; but Smaug had rather an overwhelming\\r\\npersonality.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI tell you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, in an effort to remain loyal to his friends and to keep his\\r\\nend up, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat gold was only an afterthought with us. We came over hill and under\\r\\nhill, by wave and wind, for Revenge. Surely, O Smaug the unassessably wealthy,\\r\\nyou must realize that your success has made you some bitter enemies?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then Smaug really did laugh\\xe2\\x80\\x94a devastating sound which shook Bilbo to the\\r\\nfloor, while far up in the tunnel the dwarves huddled together and imagined that\\r\\nthe hobbit had come to a sudden and a nasty end.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRevenge!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he snorted, and the light of his eyes lit the hall from floor to\\r\\nceiling like scarlet lightning. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRevenge! The King under the Mountain is dead\\r\\nand where are his kin that dare seek revenge? Girion Lord of Dale is dead, and I\\r\\nhave eaten his people like a wolf among sheep, and where are his sons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sons that\\r\\ndare approach me? I kill where I wish and none dare resist. I laid low the\\r\\nwarriors of old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and\\r\\ntender. Now I am old and strong, strong, strong, Thief in the Shadows!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ngloated. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy armour is like tenfold shields, my teeth are swords, my claws\\r\\nspears, the shock of my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath\\r\\ndeath!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have always understood,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo in a frightened squeak, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat dragons\\r\\nwere softer underneath, especially in the region of the\\xe2\\x80\\x94er\\xe2\\x80\\x94chest; but doubtless\\r\\none so fortified has thought of that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The dragon stopped short in his boasting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour information is antiquated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe snapped. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am armoured above and below with iron scales and hard gems.\\r\\nNo blade can pierce me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI might have guessed it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTruly there can nowhere be found the\\r\\nequal of Lord Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a\\r\\nwaistcoat of fine diamonds!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smaug absurdly pleased. He did\\r\\nnot know that the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his peculiar under-\\r\\ncovering on his previous visit, and was itching for a closer view for reasons of\\r\\nhis own. The dragon rolled over. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you say to that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDazzlingly marvellous! Perfect! Flawless! Staggering!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Bilbo\\r\\naloud, but what he thought inside was: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOld fool! Why, there is a large patch in\\r\\nthe hollow of his left breast as bare as a snail out of its shell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c   After he had seen that Mr. Baggins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 one idea was to get away. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, I really\\r\\nmust not detain Your Magnificence any longer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor keep you from\\r\\nmuch needed rest. Ponies take some catching, I believe, after a long start. And so\\r\\ndo burglars,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added as a parting shot, as he darted back and fled up the tunnel.\\r\\n   It was an unfortunate remark, for the dragon spouted terrific flames after him,\\r\\nand fast though he sped up the slope, he had not gone nearly far enough to be\\r\\ncomfortable before the ghastly head of Smaug was thrust against the opening\\r\\nbehind. Luckily the whole head and jaws could not squeeze in, but the nostrils\\r\\nsent forth fire and vapour to pursue him, and he was nearly overcome, and\\r\\nstumbled blindly on in great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather pleased\\r\\nwith the cleverness of his conversation with Smaug, but his mistake at the end\\r\\nshook him into better sense.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to himself, and it\\r\\nbecame a favourite saying of his later, and passed into a proverb. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nnearly through this adventure yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, and that was pretty true as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled\\r\\nand fell in a faint on the \\xe2\\x80\\x98doorstep\\xe2\\x80\\x99. The dwarves revived him, and doctored his\\r\\nscorches as well as they could; but it was a long time before the hair on the back\\r\\nof his head and his heels grew properly again: it had all been singed and frizzled\\r\\nright down to the skin. In the meanwhile his friends did their best to cheer him\\r\\nup; and they were eager for his story, especially wanting to know why the dragon\\r\\nhad made such an awful noise, and how Bilbo had escaped.\\r\\n    But the hobbit was worried and uncomfortable, and they had difficulty in\\r\\ngetting anything out of him. On thinking things over he was now regretting some\\r\\nof the things he had said to the dragon, and was not eager to repeat them. The\\r\\nold thrush was sitting on a rock near by with his head cocked on one side,\\r\\nlistening to all that was said. It shows what an ill temper Bilbo was in: he picked\\r\\nup a stone and threw it at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and came\\r\\nback.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDrat the bird!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo crossly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe he is listening, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like\\r\\nthe look of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeave him alone!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe thrushes are good and friendly\\xe2\\x80\\x94this is\\r\\na very old bird indeed, and is maybe the last left of the ancient breed that used to\\r\\nlive about here, tame to the hands of my father and grandfather. They were a\\r\\nlong-lived and magical race, and this might even be one of those that were alive\\r\\n\\x0cthen, a couple of hundreds of years or more ago. The Men of Dale used to have\\r\\nthe trick of understanding their language, and used them for messengers to fly to\\r\\nthe Men of the Lake and elsewhere.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have news to take to Lake-town all right, if that is what he is\\r\\nafter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthough I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose there are any people left there that\\r\\ntrouble with thrush-language.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy what has happened?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the dwarves. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo get on with your tale!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    So Bilbo told them all he could remember, and he confessed that he had a\\r\\nnasty feeling that the dragon guessed too much from his riddles added to the\\r\\ncamps and the ponies. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure he knows we came from Lake-town and had\\r\\nhelp from there; and I have a horrible feeling that his next move may be in that\\r\\ndirection. I wish to goodness I had never said that about Barrel-rider; it would\\r\\nmake even a blind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake-men.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, well! It cannot be helped, and it is difficult not to slip in talking to a\\r\\ndragon, or so I have always heard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin anxious to comfort him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think\\r\\nyou did very well, if you ask me\\xe2\\x80\\x94you found out one very useful thing at any\\r\\nrate, and got home alive, and that is more than most can say who have had words\\r\\nwith the likes of Smaug. It may be a mercy and a blessing yet to know of the\\r\\nbare patch in the old Worm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diamond waistcoat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    That turned the conversation, and they all began discussing dragon-slayings\\r\\nhistorical, dubious, and mythical, and the various sorts of stabs and jabs and\\r\\nundercuts, and the different arts devices and stratagems by which they had been\\r\\naccomplished. The general opinion was that catching a dragon napping was not\\r\\nas easy as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more\\r\\nlikely to end in disaster than a bold frontal attack. All the while they talked the\\r\\nthrush listened, till at last when the stars began to peep forth, it silently spread its\\r\\nwings and flew away. And all the while they talked and the shadows lengthened\\r\\nBilbo became more and more unhappy and his foreboding grew.\\r\\n    At last he interrupted them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure we are very unsafe here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the point of sitting here. The dragon has withered all the\\r\\npleasant green, and anyway the night has come and it is cold. But I feel it in my\\r\\nbones that this place will be attacked again. Smaug knows now how I came\\r\\ndown to his hall, and you can trust him to guess where the other end of the\\r\\ntunnel is. He will break all this side of the Mountain to bits, if necessary, to stop\\r\\nup our entrance, and if we are smashed with it the better he will like it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are very gloomy, Mr. Baggins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy has not Smaug\\r\\nblocked the lower end, then, if he is so eager to keep us out? He has not, or we\\r\\n\\x0cshould have heard him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know\\xe2\\x80\\x94because at first he wanted to try and lure me in\\r\\nagain, I suppose, and now perhaps because he is waiting till after tonight\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hunt,\\r\\nor because he does not want to damage his bedroom if he can help it\\xe2\\x80\\x94but I wish\\r\\nyou would not argue. Smaug will be coming out at any minute now, and our only\\r\\nhope is to get well in the tunnel and shut the door.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    He seemed so much in earnest that the dwarves at last did as he said, though\\r\\nthey delayed shutting the door\\xe2\\x80\\x94it seemed a desperate plan, for no one knew\\r\\nwhether or how they could get it open again from the inside, and the thought of\\r\\nbeing shut in a place from which the only way out led through the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lair\\r\\nwas not one they liked. Also everything seemed quite quiet, both outside and\\r\\ndown the tunnel. So for a longish while they sat inside not far down from the\\r\\nhalf-open door and went on talking.\\r\\n    The talk turned to the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wicked words about the dwarves. Bilbo\\r\\nwished he had never heard them, or at least that he could feel quite certain that\\r\\nthe dwarves now were absolutely honest when they declared that they had never\\r\\nthought at all about what would happen after the treasure had been won. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\r\\nknew it would be a desperate venture,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand we know that still; and\\r\\nI still think that when we have won it will be time enough to think what to do\\r\\nabout it. As for your share, Mr. Baggins, I assure you we are more than grateful\\r\\nand you shall choose your own fourteenth, as soon as we have anything to\\r\\ndivide. I am sorry if you are worried about transport, and I admit the difficulties\\r\\nare great\\xe2\\x80\\x94the lands have not become less wild with the passing of time, rather\\r\\nthe reverse\\xe2\\x80\\x94but we will do whatever we can for you, and take our share of the\\r\\ncost when the time comes. Believe me or not as you like!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    From that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin\\r\\nand Balin remembered. They wondered if they were still lying there unharmed in\\r\\nthe hall below: the spears that were made for the armies of the great King\\r\\nBladorthin (long since dead), each had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were\\r\\ninlaid with cunning gold, but they were never delivered or paid for; shields made\\r\\nfor warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two-handed, hammered\\r\\nand carven with birds and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; coats of\\r\\nmail gilded and silvered and impenetrable; the necklace of Girion, Lord of Dale,\\r\\nmade of five hundred emeralds green as grass, which he gave for the arming of\\r\\nhis eldest son in a coat of dwarf-linked rings the like of which had never been\\r\\nmade before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple\\r\\nsteel. But fairest of all was the great white gem, which the dwarves had found\\r\\n\\x0cbeneath the roots of the Mountain, the Heart of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of\\r\\nThrain.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Arkenstone! The Arkenstone!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d murmured Thorin in the dark, half\\r\\ndreaming with his chin upon his knees. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was like a globe with a thousand\\r\\nfacets; it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under\\r\\nthe stars, like rain upon the Moon!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    But the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from Bilbo. All through their\\r\\ntalk he was only half listening to them. He sat nearest to the door with one ear\\r\\ncocked for any beginnings of a sound without, his other was alert for echoes\\r\\nbeyond the murmurs of the dwarves, for any whisper of a movement from far\\r\\nbelow.\\r\\n    Darkness grew deeper and he grew ever more uneasy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShut the door!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nbegged them, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI fear that dragon in my marrow. I like this silence far less than\\r\\nthe uproar of last night. Shut the door before it is too late!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Something in his voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortable feeling. Slowly\\r\\nThorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that\\r\\nwedged the door. Then they thrust upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang.\\r\\nNo trace of a keyhole was there left on the inside. They were shut in the\\r\\nMountain!\\r\\n    And not a moment too soon. They had hardly gone any distance down the\\r\\ntunnel when a blow smote the side of the Mountain like the crash of battering-\\r\\nrams made of forest oaks and swung by giants. The rock boomed, the walls\\r\\ncracked and stones fell from the roof on their heads. What would have happened\\r\\nif the door had still been open I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to think. They fled further down the\\r\\ntunnel glad to be still alive, while behind them outside they heard the roar and\\r\\nrumble of Smaug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fury. He was breaking rocks to pieces, smashing wall and\\r\\ncliff with the lashings of his huge tail, till their little lofty camping ground, the\\r\\nscorched grass, the thrush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stone, the snail-covered walls, the narrow ledge, and\\r\\nall disappeared in a jumble of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered stones\\r\\nfell over the cliff into the valley below.\\r\\n    Smaug had left his lair in silent stealth, quietly soared into the air, and then\\r\\nfloated heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous crow, down the wind\\r\\ntowards the west of the Mountain, in the hopes of catching unawares something\\r\\nor somebody there, and of spying the outlet to the passage which the thief had\\r\\nused. This was the outburst of his wrath when he could find nobody and see\\r\\nnothing, even where he guessed the outlet must actually be.\\r\\n    After he had let off his rage in this way he felt better and he thought in his\\r\\n\\x0cheart that he would not be troubled again from that direction. In the meanwhile\\r\\nhe had further vengeance to take. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBarrel-rider!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he snorted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour feet came\\r\\nfrom the waterside and up the water you came without a doubt. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\nyour smell, but if you are not one of those men of the Lake, you had their help.\\r\\nThey shall see me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   He rose in fire and went away south towards the Running River.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter XIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOT AT HOME\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, and utter silence fell about them.\\r\\nLittle they ate and little they spoke. They could not count the passing of time;\\r\\nand they scarcely dared to move, for the whisper of their voices echoed and\\r\\nrustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness and to silence\\r\\ngoing on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when\\r\\nthey were becoming choked and dazed for want of air, they could bear it no\\r\\nlonger. They would almost have welcomed sounds from below of the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nreturn. In the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his, but they could not\\r\\nsit there for ever.\\r\\n     Thorin spoke: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us try the door!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must feel the wind on my face\\r\\nsoon or die. I think I would rather be smashed by Smaug in the open than\\r\\nsuffocate in here!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where\\r\\nthe door had been. But they found that the upper end of the tunnel had been\\r\\nshattered and blocked with broken rock. Neither key nor the magic it had once\\r\\nobeyed would ever open that door again.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are trapped!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they groaned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the end. We shall die here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     But somehow, just when the dwarves were most despairing, Bilbo felt a\\r\\nstrange lightening of the heart, as if a heavy weight had gone from under his\\r\\nwaistcoat.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome, come!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98While there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hope!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as my father used\\r\\nto say, and \\xe2\\x80\\x98Third time pays for all.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I am going down the tunnel once again. I\\r\\nhave been that way twice, when I knew there was a dragon at the other end, so I\\r\\nwill risk a third visit when I am no longer sure. Anyway the only way out is\\r\\ndown. And I think this time you had better all come with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first to go forward by Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\n\\x0cside.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow do be careful!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whispered the hobbit, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand as quiet as you can be!\\r\\nThere may be no Smaug at the bottom, but then again there may be. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let us\\r\\ntake any unnecessary risks!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Down, down they went. The dwarves could not, of course, compare with the\\r\\nhobbit in real stealth, and they made a deal of puffing and shuffling which\\r\\nechoes magnified alarmingly; but though every now and again Bilbo in fear\\r\\nstopped and listened, not a sound stirred below. Near the bottom, as well as he\\r\\ncould judge, Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did not need it: the\\r\\ndarkness was complete, and they were all invisible, ring or no ring. In fact so\\r\\nblack was it that the hobbit came to the opening unexpectedly, put his hand on\\r\\nair, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong into the hall!\\r\\n    There he lay face downwards on the floor and did not dare to get up, or\\r\\nhardly even to breathe. But nothing moved. There was not a gleam of light\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nunless, as it seemed to him, when at last he slowly raised his head, there was a\\r\\npale white glint, above him and far off in the gloom. But certainly it was not a\\r\\nspark of dragon-fire, though the worm-stench was heavy in the place, and the\\r\\ntaste of vapour was on his tongue.\\r\\n    At length Mr. Baggins could bear it no longer. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConfound you, Smaug, you\\r\\nworm!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he squeaked aloud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStop playing hide-and-seek! Give me a light, and\\r\\nthen eat me, if you can catch me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer.\\r\\n    Bilbo got up, and found that he did not know in what direction to turn.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I wonder what on earth Smaug is playing at,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is not at\\r\\nhome today (or tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin and Gloin have\\r\\nnot lost their tinder-boxes, perhaps we can make a little light, and have a look\\r\\nround before the luck turns.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLight!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan anybody make a light?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the\\r\\nstep with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them\\r\\nat the end of the tunnel.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSh! sh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they hissed, when they heard his voice; and though that helped the\\r\\nhobbit to find out where they were, it was some time before he could get\\r\\nanything else out of them. But in the end, when Bilbo actually began to stamp on\\r\\nthe floor, and screamed out \\xe2\\x80\\x9clight!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the top of his shrill voice, Thorin gave\\r\\n\\x0cway, and Oin and Gloin were sent back to their bundles at the top of the tunnel.\\r\\n     After a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning, Oin with a small\\r\\npine-torch alight in his hand, and Gloin with a bundle of others under his arm.\\r\\nQuickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the torch; but he could not persuade\\r\\nthe dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet. As Thorin carefully\\r\\nexplained, Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator. If\\r\\nhe liked to risk a light, that was his affair. They would wait in the tunnel for his\\r\\nreport. So they sat near the door and watched.\\r\\n     They saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding his\\r\\ntiny light aloft. Every now and again, while he was still near enough, they caught\\r\\na glint and a tinkle as he stumbled on some golden thing. The light grew smaller\\r\\nas he wandered away into the vast hall; then it began to rise dancing into the air.\\r\\nBilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure. Soon he stood upon the top, and\\r\\nstill went on. Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment; but they did not\\r\\nknow the reason.\\r\\n     It was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain. So Bilbo guessed from\\r\\nThorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s description; but indeed there could not be two such gems, even in so\\r\\nmarvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as he climbed, the same white\\r\\ngleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards it. Slowly it grew to a\\r\\nlittle globe of pallid light. Now as he came near, it was tinged with a flickering\\r\\nsparkle of many colours at the surface, reflected and splintered from the\\r\\nwavering light of his torch. At last he looked down upon it, and he caught his\\r\\nbreath. The great jewel shone before his feet of its own inner light, and yet, cut\\r\\nand fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug it from the heart of the mountain\\r\\nlong ago, it took all light that fell upon it and changed it into ten thousand sparks\\r\\nof white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow.\\r\\n     Suddenly Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm went towards it drawn by its enchantment. His small\\r\\nhand would not close about it, for it was a large and heavy gem; but he lifted it,\\r\\nshut his eyes, and put it in his deepest pocket.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I am a burglar indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I suppose I must tell the\\r\\ndwarves about it\\xe2\\x80\\x94some time. They did say I could pick and choose my own\\r\\nshare; and I think I would choose this, if they took all the rest!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d All the same he\\r\\nhad an uncomfortable feeling that the picking and choosing had not really been\\r\\nmeant to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble would yet come of it.\\r\\n     Now he went on again. Down the other side of the great mound he climbed,\\r\\nand the spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves. But\\r\\nsoon they saw it far away in the distance again. Bilbo was crossing the floor of\\r\\n\\x0cthe hall.\\r\\n    He went on, until he came to the great doors at the further side, and there a\\r\\ndraught of air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his light. He peeped timidly\\r\\nthrough, and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings of\\r\\nwide stairs going up into the gloom. And still there was no sight nor sound of\\r\\nSmaug. He was just going to turn and go back, when a black shape swooped at\\r\\nhim, and brushed his face. He squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and\\r\\nfell. His torch dropped head downwards and went out!\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly a bat, I suppose and hope!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said miserably. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut now what am I to\\r\\ndo? Which is East, South, North, or West?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fili! Kili!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried as loud as he could\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\r\\nseemed a thin little noise in the wide blackness. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe light\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone out! Someone\\r\\ncome and find me and help me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For the moment his courage had failed\\r\\naltogether.\\r\\n    Faintly the dwarves heard his small cries, though the only word they could\\r\\ncatch was \\xe2\\x80\\x9chelp!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow what on earth or under it has happened?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly not\\r\\nthe dragon, or he would not go on squeaking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    They waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no\\r\\nsound at all in fact but Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distant voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome, one of you, get another\\r\\nlight or two!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thorin ordered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems we have got to go and help our burglar.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is about our turn to help,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I am quite willing to go.\\r\\nAnyway I expect it is safe for the moment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Gloin lit several more torches, and then they all crept out, one by one, and\\r\\nwent along the wall as hurriedly as they could. It was not long before they met\\r\\nBilbo himself coming back towards them. His wits had quickly returned as soon\\r\\nas he saw the twinkle of their lights.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnly a bat and a dropped torch, nothing worse!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in answer to their\\r\\nquestions. Though they were much relieved, they were inclined to be grumpy at\\r\\nbeing frightened for nothing; but what they would have said, if he had told them\\r\\nat that moment about the Arkenstone, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. The mere fleeting glimpses\\r\\nof treasure which they had caught as they went along had rekindled all the fire of\\r\\ntheir dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, even the most respectable,\\r\\nis wakened by gold and by jewels, he grows suddenly bold, and he may become\\r\\nfierce.\\r\\n    The dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging. All were now eager to\\r\\nexplore the hall while they had the chance, and willing to believe that, for the\\r\\n\\x0cpresent, Smaug was away from home. Each now gripped a lighted torch; and as\\r\\nthey gazed, first on one side and then on another, they forgot fear and even\\r\\ncaution. They spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as they lifted old\\r\\ntreasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light, caressing\\r\\nand fingering them.\\r\\n    Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging there\\r\\nmany golden harps strung with silver they took them and struck them; and being\\r\\nmagical (and also untouched by the dragon, who had small interest in music)\\r\\nthey were still in tune. The dark hall was filled with a melody that had long been\\r\\nsilent. But most of the dwarves were more practical: they gathered gems and\\r\\nstuffed their pockets, and let what they could not carry fall back through their\\r\\nfingers with a sigh. Thorin was not least among these; but always he searched\\r\\nfrom side to side for something which he could not find. It was the Arkenstone;\\r\\nbut he spoke of it yet to no one.\\r\\n    Now the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls, and armed\\r\\nthemselves. Royal indeed did Thorin look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings,\\r\\nwith a silver-hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr. Baggins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere is the first payment of your reward! Cast off\\r\\nyour old coat and put on this!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    With that he put on Bilbo a small coat of mail, wrought for some young elf-\\r\\nprince long ago. It was of silver-steel, which the elves call mithril, and with it\\r\\nwent a belt of pearls and crystals. A light helm of figured leather, strengthened\\r\\nbeneath with hoops of steel, and studded about the brim with white gems, was\\r\\nset upon the hobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel magnificent,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I expect I look rather absurd. How they\\r\\nwould laugh on the Hill at home! Still I wish there was a looking-glass handy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    All the same Mr. Baggins kept his head more clear of the bewitchment of the\\r\\nhoard than the dwarves did. Long before the dwarves were tired of examining\\r\\nthe treasures, he became weary of it and sat down on the floor; and he began to\\r\\nwonder nervously what the end of it all would be. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would give a good many of\\r\\nthese precious goblets,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor a drink of something cheering out of\\r\\none of Beorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wooden bowls!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThorin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried aloud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat next? We are armed, but what good has any\\r\\narmour ever been before against Smaug the Dreadful? This treasure is not yet\\r\\nwon back. We are not looking for gold yet, but for a way of escape; and we have\\r\\ntempted luck too long!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou speak the truth!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Thorin, recovering his wits. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us go! I\\r\\n\\x0cwill guide you. Not in a thousand years should I forget the ways of this palace.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nThen he hailed the others, and they gathered together, and holding their torches\\r\\nabove their heads they passed through the gaping doors, not without many a\\r\\nbackward glance of longing.\\r\\n    Their glittering mail they had covered again with their old cloaks and their\\r\\nbright helms with their tattered hoods, and one by one they walked behind\\r\\nThorin, a line of little lights in the darkness that halted often, listening in fear\\r\\nonce more for any rumour of the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming.\\r\\n    Though all the old adornments were long mouldered or destroyed, and\\r\\nthough all was befouled and blasted with the comings and goings of the monster,\\r\\nThorin knew every passage and every turn. They climbed long stairs, and turned\\r\\nand went down wide echoing ways, and turned again and climbed yet more\\r\\nstairs, and yet more stairs again. These were smooth, cut out of the living rock\\r\\nbroad and fair; and up, up, the dwarves went, and they met no sign of any living\\r\\nthing, only furtive shadows that fled from the approach of their torches fluttering\\r\\nin the draughts.\\r\\n    The steps were not made, all the same, for hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was just\\r\\nfeeling that he could go on no longer, when suddenly the roof sprang high and\\r\\nfar beyond the reach of their torch-light. A white glimmer could be seen coming\\r\\nthrough some opening far above, and the air smelt sweeter. Before them light\\r\\ncame dimly through great doors, that hung twisted on their hinges and half burnt.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the great chamber of Thror,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe hall of feasting and of\\r\\ncouncil. Not far off now is the Front Gate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    They passed through the ruined chamber. Tables were rotting there; chairs\\r\\nand benches were lying there overturned, charred and decaying. Skulls and\\r\\nbones were upon the floor among flagons and bowls and broken drinking-horns\\r\\nand dust. As they came through yet more doors at the further end, a sound of\\r\\nwater fell upon their ears, and the grey light grew suddenly more full.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is the birth of the Running River,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom here it hastens\\r\\nto the Gate. Let us follow it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Out of a dark opening in a wall of rock there issued a boiling water, and it\\r\\nflowed swirling in a narrow channel, carved and made straight and deep by the\\r\\ncunning of ancient hands. Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough for\\r\\nmany men abreast. Swiftly along this they ran, and round a wide-sweeping turn\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94and behold! before them stood the broad light of day. In front there rose a tall\\r\\narch, still showing the fragments of old carven work within, worn and splintered\\r\\nand blackened though it was. A misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of\\r\\n\\x0cthe Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the pavement at the threshold.\\r\\n    A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches flurried\\r\\nover them; as they sprang forward their feet slithered on stones rubbed smooth\\r\\nand slimed by the passing of the dragon. Now before them the water fell noisily\\r\\noutward and foamed down towards the valley. They flung their pale torches to\\r\\nthe ground, and stood gazing out with dazzled eyes. They were come to the\\r\\nFront Gate, and were looking out upon Dale.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never expected to be looking out of this door. And I\\r\\nnever expected to be so pleased to see the sun again, and to feel the wind on my\\r\\nface. But, ow! this wind is cold!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    It was. A bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter. It\\r\\nswirled over and round the arms of the Mountain into the valley, and sighed\\r\\namong the rocks. After their long time in the stewing depths of the dragon-\\r\\nhaunted caverns, they shivered in the sun.\\r\\n    Suddenly Bilbo realized that he was not only tired but also very hungry\\r\\nindeed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt seems to be late morning,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand so I suppose it is more or\\r\\nless breakfast-time\\xe2\\x80\\x94if there is any breakfast to have. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel that\\r\\nSmaug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s front doorstep is the safest place for a meal. Do let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go somewhere\\r\\nwhere we can sit quiet for a bit!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite right!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I think I know which way we should go: we\\r\\nought to make for the old look-out post at the South-West corner of the\\r\\nMountain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow far is that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the hobbit.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFive hours march, I should think. It will be rough going. The road from the\\r\\nGate along the left edge of the stream seems all broken up. But look down there!\\r\\nThe river loops suddenly east across Dale in front of the ruined town. At that\\r\\npoint there was once a bridge, leading to steep stairs that climbed up the right\\r\\nbank, and so to a road running towards Ravenhill. There is (or was) a path that\\r\\nleft the road and climbed up to the post. A hard climb, too, even if the old steps\\r\\nare still there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grumbled the hobbit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMore walking and more climbing without\\r\\nbreakfast! I wonder how many breakfasts, and other meals, we have missed\\r\\ninside that nasty clockless, timeless hole?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    As a matter of fact two nights and the day between had gone by (and not\\r\\naltogether without food) since the dragon smashed the magic door, but Bilbo had\\r\\nquite lost count, and it might have been one night or a week of nights for all he\\r\\ncould tell.\\r\\n\\x0c   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome, come!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin laughing\\xe2\\x80\\x94his spirits had begun to rise again,\\r\\nand he rattled the precious stones in his pockets. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t call my palace a nasty\\r\\nhole! You wait till it has been cleaned and redecorated!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be till Smaug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dead,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo glumly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the meanwhile\\r\\nwhere is he? I would give a good breakfast to know. I hope he is not up on the\\r\\nMountain looking down at us!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   That idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and they quickly decided that Bilbo\\r\\nand Balin were right.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must move away from here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dori. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel as if his eyes were on the\\r\\nback of my head.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a cold lonesome place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bombur. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere may be drink, but I see no\\r\\nsign of food. A dragon would always be hungry in such parts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on! Come on!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the others. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us follow Balin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s path!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the rocky wall to the right there was no path, so on they trudged among\\r\\nthe stones on the left side of the river, and the emptiness and desolation soon\\r\\nsobered even Thorin again. The bridge that Balin had spoken of they found long\\r\\nfallen, and most of its stones were now only boulders in the shallow noisy\\r\\nstream; but they forded the water without much difficulty, and found the ancient\\r\\nsteps, and climbed the high bank. After going a short way they struck the old\\r\\nroad, and before long came to a deep dell sheltered among the rocks; there they\\r\\nrested for a while and had such a breakfast as they could, chiefly cram and\\r\\nwater. (If you want to know what cram is, I can only say that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the\\r\\nrecipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining,\\r\\nand is certainly not entertaining, being in fact very uninteresting except as a\\r\\nchewing exercise. It was made by the Lake-men for long journeys.)\\r\\n    After that they went on again; and now the road struck westwards and left the\\r\\nriver, and the great shoulder of the south-pointing mountain-spur drew ever\\r\\nnearer. At length they reached the hill path. It scrambled steeply up, and they\\r\\nplodded slowly one behind the other, till at last in the late afternoon they came to\\r\\nthe top of the ridge and saw the wintry sun going downwards to the West.\\r\\n    Here they found a flat place without a wall on three sides, but backed to the\\r\\nNorth by a rocky face in which there was an opening like a door. From that door\\r\\nthere was a wide view East and South and West.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin the old days we used always to keep watchmen, and\\r\\nthat door behind leads into a rockhewn chamber that was made here as a\\r\\n\\x0cguardroom. There were several places like it round the Mountain. But there\\r\\nseemed small need for watching in the days of our prosperity, and the guards\\r\\nwere made over comfortable, perhaps\\xe2\\x80\\x94otherwise we might have had longer\\r\\nwarning of the coming of the dragon, and things might have been different. Still,\\r\\nhere we can now lie hid and sheltered for a while, and can see much without\\r\\nbeing seen.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot much use, if we have been seen coming here,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Dori, who was\\r\\nalways looking up towards the Mountain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peak, as if he expected to see Smaug\\r\\nperched there like a bird on a steeple.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must take our chance of that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can go no further to-\\r\\nday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHear, hear!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bilbo, and flung himself on the ground.\\r\\n   In the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there\\r\\nwas a small chamber further in, more removed from the cold outside. It was\\r\\nquite deserted; not even wild animals seemed to have used it in all the days of\\r\\nSmaug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dominion. There they laid their burdens; and some threw themselves\\r\\ndown at once and slept, but the others sat near the outer door and discussed their\\r\\nplans. In all their talk they came perpetually back to one thing: where was\\r\\nSmaug? They looked West and there was nothing, and East there was nothing,\\r\\nand in the South there was no sign of the dragon, but there was a gathering of\\r\\nvery many birds. At that they gazed and wondered; but they were no nearer\\r\\nunderstanding it, when the first cold stars came out.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter XIV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRE AND WATER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news of Smaug, you must go back\\r\\nagain to the evening when he smashed the door and flew off in rage, two days\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n   The men of the lake-town Esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was\\r\\nfrom the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and\\r\\nwatching, as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth\\r\\npatches of the lake as they opened in the sky. From their town the Lonely\\r\\nMountain was mostly screened by the low hills at the far end of the lake, through\\r\\na gap in which the Running River came down from the North. Only its high peak\\r\\ncould they see in clear weather, and they looked seldom at it, for it was ominous\\r\\nand drear even in the light of morning. Now it was lost and gone, blotted in the\\r\\ndark.\\r\\n   Suddenly it flickered back to view; a brief glow touched it and faded.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe lights again! Last night the watchmen saw them start\\r\\nand fade from midnight until dawn. Something is happening up there.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps the King under the Mountain is forging gold,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said another. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is\\r\\nlong since he went North. It is time the songs began to prove themselves again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich king?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said another with a grim voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs like as not it is the\\r\\nmarauding fire of the Dragon, the only king under the Mountain we have ever\\r\\nknown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are always foreboding gloomy things!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the others. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnything from\\r\\nfloods to poisoned fish. Think of something cheerful!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   Then suddenly a great light appeared in the low place in the hills and the\\r\\nnorthern end of the lake turned golden. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe King beneath the Mountain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they\\r\\nshouted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis wealth is like the Sun, his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden\\r\\n\\x0crun! The river is running gold from the Mountain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried, and everywhere\\r\\nwindows were opening and feet were hurrying.\\r\\n    There was once more a tremendous excitement and enthusiasm. But the grim-\\r\\nvoiced fellow ran hotfoot to the Master. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe dragon is coming or I am a fool!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCut the bridges! To arms! To arms!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then warning trumpets were suddenly sounded, and echoed along the rocky\\r\\nshores. The cheering stopped and the joy was turned to dread. So it was that the\\r\\ndragon did not find them quite unprepared.\\r\\n    Before long, so great was his speed, they could see him as a spark of fire\\r\\nrushing towards them and growing ever huger and more bright, and not the most\\r\\nfoolish doubted that the prophecies had gone rather wrong. Still they had a little\\r\\ntime. Every vessel in the town was filled with water, every warrior was armed,\\r\\nevery arrow and dart was ready, and the bridge to the land was thrown down and\\r\\ndestroyed, before the roar of Smaug\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible approach grew loud, and the lake\\r\\nrippled red as fire beneath the awful beating of his wings.\\r\\n    Amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of men he came over them, swept\\r\\ntowards the bridges and was foiled! The bridge was gone, and his enemies were\\r\\non an island in deep water\\xe2\\x80\\x94too deep and dark and cool for his liking. If he\\r\\nplunged into it, a vapour and a steam would arise enough to cover all the land\\r\\nwith a mist for days; but the lake was mightier than he, it would quench him\\r\\nbefore he could pass through.\\r\\n    Roaring he swept back over the town. A hail of dark arrows leaped up and\\r\\nsnapped and rattled on his scales and jewels, and their shafts fell back kindled by\\r\\nhis breath burning and hissing into the lake. No fireworks you ever imagined\\r\\nequalled the sights that night. At the twanging of the bows and the shrilling of\\r\\nthe trumpets the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrath blazed to its height, till he was blind and mad\\r\\nwith it. No one had dared to give battle to him for many an age; nor would they\\r\\nhave dared now, if it had not been for the grim-voiced man (Bard was his name),\\r\\nwho ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the Master to order them\\r\\nto fight to the last arrow.\\r\\n    Fire leaped from the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jaws. He circled for a while high in the air\\r\\nabove them lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and\\r\\nlike blood with leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he\\r\\nswooped straight through the arrow-storm, reckless in his rage, taking no heed to\\r\\nturn his scaly sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze.\\r\\n    Fire leaped from thatched roofs and wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down\\r\\nand past and round again, though all had been drenched with water before he\\r\\n\\x0ccame. Once more water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark\\r\\nappeared. Back swirled the dragon. A sweep of his tail and the roof of the Great\\r\\nHouse crumbled and smashed down. Flames unquenchable sprang high into the\\r\\nnight. Another swoop and another, and another house and then another sprang\\r\\nafire and fell; and still no arrow hindered Smaug or hurt him more than a fly\\r\\nfrom the marshes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready men were jumping into the water on every side. Women and children\\r\\nwere being huddled into laden boats in the market-pool. Weapons were flung\\r\\ndown. There was mourning and weeping, where but a little time ago the old\\r\\nsongs of mirth to come had been sung about the dwarves. Now men cursed their\\r\\nnames. The Master himself was turning to his great gilded boat, hoping to row\\r\\naway in the confusion and save himself. Soon all the town would be deserted\\r\\nand burned down to the surface of the lake.\\r\\n    That was the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hope. They could all get into boats for all he cared.\\r\\nThere he could have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop till they starved.\\r\\nLet them try to get to land and he would be ready. Soon he would set all the\\r\\nshoreland woods ablaze and wither every field and pasture. Just now he was\\r\\nenjoying the sport of town-baiting more than he had enjoyed anything for years.\\r\\n    But there was still a company of archers that held their ground among the\\r\\nburning houses. Their captain was Bard, grim-voiced and grim-faced, whose\\r\\nfriends had accused him of prophesying floods and poisoned fish, though they\\r\\nknew his worth and courage. He was a descendant in long line of Girion, Lord of\\r\\nDale, whose wife and child had escaped down the Running River from the ruin\\r\\nlong ago. Now he shot with a great yew bow, till all his arrows but one were\\r\\nspent. The flames were near him. His companions were leaving him. He bent his\\r\\nbow for the last time.\\r\\n    Suddenly out of the dark something fluttered to his shoulder. He started\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\r\\nit was only an old thrush. Unafraid it perched by his ear and it brought him news.\\r\\nMarvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for he was of the race of\\r\\nDale.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait! Wait!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it said to him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe moon is rising. Look for the hollow of the\\r\\nleft breast as he flies and turns above you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And while Bard paused in wonder it\\r\\ntold him of tidings up in the Mountain and of all that it had heard.\\r\\n    Then Bard drew his bow-string to his ear. The dragon was circling back,\\r\\nflying low, and as he came the moon rose above the eastern shore and silvered\\r\\n\\x0chis great wings.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArrow!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the bowman. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlack arrow! I have saved you to the last. You\\r\\nhave never failed me and always I have recovered you. I had you from my father\\r\\nand he from of old. If ever you came from the forges of the true king under the\\r\\nMountain, go now and speed well!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The dragon swooped once more lower than ever, and as he turned and dived\\r\\ndown his belly glittered white with sparkling fires of gems in the moon\\xe2\\x80\\x94but not\\r\\nin one place. The great bow twanged. The black arrow sped straight from the\\r\\nstring, straight for the hollow by the left breast where the foreleg was flung wide.\\r\\nIn it smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so fierce was its flight. With a\\r\\nshriek that deafened men, felled trees and split stone, Smaug shot spouting into\\r\\nthe air, turned over and crashed down from on high in ruin.\\r\\n    Full on the town he fell. His last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes. The\\r\\nlake roared in. A vast steam leaped up, white in the sudden dark under the moon.\\r\\nThere was a hiss, a gushing whirl, and then silence. And that was the end of\\r\\nSmaug and Esgaroth, but not of Bard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waxing moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and cold. It\\r\\ntwisted the white fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and drove it off to\\r\\nthe West to scatter in tattered shreds over the marshes before Mirkwood. Then\\r\\nthe many boats could be seen dotted dark on the surface of the lake, and down\\r\\nthe wind came the voices of the people of Esgaroth lamenting their lost town and\\r\\ngoods and ruined houses. But they had really much to be thankful for, had they\\r\\nthought of it, though it could hardly be expected that they should just then: three\\r\\nquarters of the people of the town had at least escaped alive; their woods and\\r\\nfields and pastures and cattle and most of their boats remained undamaged; and\\r\\nthe dragon was dead. What that meant they had not yet realized.\\r\\n    They gathered in mournful crowds upon the western shores, shivering in the\\r\\ncold wind, and their first complaints and anger were against the Master, who had\\r\\nleft the town so soon, while some were still willing to defend it.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe may have a good head for business\\xe2\\x80\\x94especially his own business,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d some\\r\\nmurmured, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut he is no good when anything serious happens!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And they\\r\\npraised the courage of Bard and his last mighty shot. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf only he had not been\\r\\nkilled,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they all said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe would make him a king. Bard the Dragon-shooter of\\r\\nthe line of Girion! Alas that he is lost!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    And in the very midst of their talk a tall figure stepped from the shadows. He\\r\\n\\x0cwas drenched with water, his black hair hung wet over his face and shoulders,\\r\\nand a fierce light was in his eyes.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBard is not lost!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe dived from Esgaroth, when the enemy was\\r\\nslain. I am Bard, of the line of Girion; I am the slayer of the dragon!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKing Bard! King Bard!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they shouted; but the Master ground his chattering\\r\\nteeth.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGirion was lord of Dale, not king of Esgaroth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the Lake-town\\r\\nwe have always elected masters from among the old and wise, and have not\\r\\nendured the rule of mere fighting men. Let \\xe2\\x80\\x98King Bard\\xe2\\x80\\x99 go back to his own\\r\\nkingdom\\xe2\\x80\\x94Dale is now freed by his valour, and nothing hinders his return. And\\r\\nany that wish can go with him, if they prefer the cold stones under the shadow of\\r\\nthe Mountain to the green shores of the lake. The wise will stay here and hope to\\r\\nrebuild our town, and enjoy again in time its peace and riches.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will have King Bard!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the people near at hand shouted in reply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\r\\nhave had enough of the old men and the money-counters!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And people further\\r\\noff took up the cry: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUp the Bowman, and down with Moneybags,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d till the\\r\\nclamour echoed along the shore.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the last man to undervalue Bard the Bowman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the Master warily\\r\\n(for Bard now stood close beside him). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has tonight earned an eminent place\\r\\nin the roll of the benefactors of our town; and he is worthy of many imperishable\\r\\nsongs. But, why O People?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94and here the Master rose to his feet and spoke\\r\\nvery loud and clear\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy do I get all your blame? For what fault am I to be\\r\\ndeposed? Who aroused the dragon from his slumber, I might ask? Who obtained\\r\\nof us rich gifts and ample help, and led us to believe that old songs could come\\r\\ntrue? Who played on our soft hearts and our pleasant fancies? What sort of gold\\r\\nhave they sent down the river to reward us? Dragon-fire and ruin! From whom\\r\\nshould we claim the recompense of our damage, and aid for our widows and\\r\\norphans?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    As you see, the Master had not got his position for nothing. The result of his\\r\\nwords was that for the moment the people quite forgot their idea of a new king,\\r\\nand turned their angry thoughts towards Thorin and his company. Wild and bitter\\r\\nwords were shouted from many sides; and some of those who had before sung\\r\\nthe old songs loudest, were now heard as loudly crying that the dwarves had\\r\\nstirred the dragon up against them deliberately!\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFools!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy waste words and wrath on those unhappy\\r\\ncreatures? Doubtless they perished first in fire, before Smaug came to us.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then\\r\\neven as he was speaking, the thought came into his heart of the fabled treasure of\\r\\n\\x0cthe Mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly silent. He\\r\\nthought of the Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words, and of Dale rebuilt, and filled with golden bells,\\r\\nif he could but find the men.\\r\\n    At length he spoke again: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is no time for angry words, Master, or for\\r\\nconsidering weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I serve you still\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nthough after a while I may think again of your words and go North with any that\\r\\nwill follow me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then he strode off to help in the ordering of the camps and in the care of the\\r\\nsick and the wounded. But the Master scowled at his back as he went, and\\r\\nremained sitting on the ground. He thought much but said little, unless it was to\\r\\ncall loudly for men to bring him fire and food.\\r\\n    Now everywhere Bard went he found talk running like fire among the people\\r\\nconcerning the vast treasure that was now unguarded. Men spoke of the\\r\\nrecompense for all their harm that they would soon get from it, and wealth over\\r\\nand to spare with which to buy rich things from the South; and it cheered them\\r\\ngreatly in their plight. That was as well, for the night was bitter and miserable.\\r\\nShelters could be contrived for few (the Master had one) and there was little\\r\\nfood (even the Master went short). Many took ill of wet and cold and sorrow that\\r\\nnight, and afterwards died, who had escaped uninjured from the ruin of the town;\\r\\nand in the days that followed there was much sickness and great hunger.\\r\\n    Meanwhile Bard took the lead, and ordered things as he wished, though\\r\\nalways in the Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name, and he had a hard task to govern the people and\\r\\ndirect the preparations for their protection and housing. Probably most of them\\r\\nwould have perished in the winter that now hurried after autumn, if help had not\\r\\nbeen to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers\\r\\nsent up the river to the Forest to ask the aid of the King of the Elves of the\\r\\nWood, and these messengers had found a host already on the move, although it\\r\\nwas then only the third day after the fall of Smaug.\\r\\n    The Elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the\\r\\nbirds that loved his folk, and already knew much of what had happened. Very\\r\\ngreat indeed was the commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the\\r\\nborders of the Desolation of the Dragon. The air was filled with circling flocks,\\r\\nand their swift-flying messengers flew here and there across the sky. Above the\\r\\nborders of the Forest there was whistling, crying and piping. Far over Mirkwood\\r\\ntidings spread: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmaug is dead!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted.\\r\\nEven before the Elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to the\\r\\npinewoods of the Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and\\r\\n\\x0cthe goblins were at council in their caves.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat will be the last we shall hear of Thorin Oakenshield, I fear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the\\r\\nking. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe would have done better to have remained my guest. It is an ill wind,\\r\\nall the same,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat blows no one any good.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For he too had not\\r\\nforgotten the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it was that Bard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s messengers\\r\\nfound him now marching with many spearmen and bowmen; and crows were\\r\\ngathered thick above him, for they thought that war was awakening again, such\\r\\nas had not been in those parts for a long age.\\r\\n    But the king, when he received the prayers of Bard, had pity, for he was the\\r\\nlord of a good and kindly people; so turning his march, which had at first been\\r\\ndirect towards the Mountain, he hastened now down the river to the Long Lake.\\r\\nHe had not boats or rafts enough for his host, and they were forced to go the\\r\\nslower way by foot; but great store of goods he sent ahead by water. Still elves\\r\\nare light-footed, and though they were not in these days much used to the\\r\\nmarches and the treacherous lands between the Forest and the Lake, their going\\r\\nwas swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon the\\r\\nshores and looked on the ruins of the town. Their welcome was good, as may be\\r\\nexpected, and the men and their Master were ready to make any bargain for the\\r\\nfuture in return for the Elvenking\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aid.\\r\\n    Their plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old and\\r\\nthe unfit, the Master remained behind; and with him were some men of crafts\\r\\nand many skilled elves; and they busied themselves felling trees, and collecting\\r\\nthe timber sent down from the Forest. Then they set about raising many huts by\\r\\nthe shore against the oncoming winter; and also under the Master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s direction\\r\\nthey began the planning of a new town, designed more fair and large even than\\r\\nbefore, but not in the same place. They removed northward higher up the shore;\\r\\nfor ever after they had a dread of the water where the dragon lay. He would\\r\\nnever again return to his golden bed, but was stretched cold as stone, twisted\\r\\nupon the floor of the shallows. There for ages his huge bones could be seen in\\r\\ncalm weather amid the ruined piles of the old town. But few dared to cross the\\r\\ncursed spot, and none dared to dive into the shivering water or recover the\\r\\nprecious stones that fell from his rotting carcase.\\r\\n    But all the men of arms who were still able, and the most of the Elvenking\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\narray, got ready to march north to the Mountain. It was thus that in eleven days\\r\\nfrom the ruin of the town the head of their host passed the rock-gates at the end\\r\\nof the lake and came into the desolate lands.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter XV\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GATHERING OF THE CLOUDS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves. All night one of them had\\r\\nwatched, but when morning came they had not heard or seen any sign of danger.\\r\\nBut ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying\\r\\nfrom the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were wheeling\\r\\nand crying unceasingly above.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething strange is happening,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe time has gone for the\\r\\nautumn wanderings; and these are birds that dwell always in the land; there are\\r\\nstarlings and flocks of finches; and far off there are many carrion birds as if a\\r\\nbattle were afoot!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Suddenly Bilbo pointed: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is that old thrush again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\r\\nseems to have escaped, when Smaug smashed the mountain-side, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nsuppose the snails have!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Sure enough the old thrush was there, and as Bilbo pointed, he flew towards\\r\\nthem and perched on a stone near by. Then he fluttered his wings and sang; then\\r\\nhe cocked his head on one side, as if to listen; and again he sang, and again he\\r\\nlistened.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI believe he is trying to tell us something,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I cannot follow\\r\\nthe speech of such birds, it is very quick and difficult. Can you make it out\\r\\nBaggins?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo (as a matter of fact, he could make nothing of it\\r\\nat all); \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the old fellow seems very excited.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI only wish he was a raven!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought you did not like them! You seemed very shy of them, when we\\r\\ncame this way before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThose were crows! And nasty suspicious-looking creatures at that, and rude\\r\\n\\x0cas well. You must have heard the ugly names they were calling after us. But the\\r\\nravens are different. There used to be great friendship between them and the\\r\\npeople of Thror; and they often brought us secret news, and were rewarded with\\r\\nsuch bright things as they coveted to hide in their dwellings.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey live many a year, and their memories are long, and they hand on their\\r\\nwisdom to their children. I knew many among the ravens of the rocks when I\\r\\nwas a dwarf-lad. This very height was once named Ravenhill, because there was\\r\\na wise and famous pair, old Carc and his wife, that lived here above the guard-\\r\\nchamber. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t suppose that any of that ancient breed linger here now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    No sooner had he finished speaking than the old thrush gave a loud call, and\\r\\nimmediately flew away.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe may not understand him, but that old bird understands us, I am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Balin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeep watch now, and see what happens!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Before long there was a fluttering of wings, and back came the thrush; and\\r\\nwith him came a most decrepit old bird. He was getting blind, he could hardly\\r\\nfly, and the top of his head was bald. He was an aged raven of great size. He\\r\\nalighted stiffly on the ground before them, slowly flapped his wings, and bobbed\\r\\ntowards Thorin.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO Thorin son of Thrain, and Balin son of Fundin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he croaked (and Bilbo\\r\\ncould understand what he said, for he used ordinary language and not bird-\\r\\nspeech). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am Ro\\xc3\\xa4c son of Carc. Carc is dead, but he was well known to you\\r\\nonce. It is a hundred years and three and fifty since I came out of the egg, but I\\r\\ndo not forget what my father told me. Now I am the chief of the great ravens of\\r\\nthe Mountain. We are few, but we remember still the king that was of old. Most\\r\\nof my people are abroad, for there are great tidings in the South\\xe2\\x80\\x94some are\\r\\ntidings of joy to you, and some you will not think so good.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBehold! the birds are gathering back again to the Mountain and to Dale from\\r\\nSouth and East and West, for word has gone out that Smaug is dead!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDead! Dead?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted the dwarves. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDead! Then we have been in needless\\r\\nfear\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the treasure is ours!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They all sprang up and began to caper about for\\r\\njoy.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, dead,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ro\\xc3\\xa4c. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw him die,\\r\\nand we may trust his words. He saw him fall in battle with the men of Esgaroth\\r\\nthe third night back from now at the rising of the moon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    It was some time before Thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and\\r\\nlisten to the raven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s news. At length when he had told all the tale of the battle he\\r\\nwent on:\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo much for joy, Thorin Oakenshield. You may go back to your halls in\\r\\nsafety; all the treasure is yours\\xe2\\x80\\x94for the moment. But many are gathering hither\\r\\nbeside the birds. The news of the death of the guardian has already gone far and\\r\\nwide, and the legend of the wealth of Thror has not lost in the telling during\\r\\nmany years; many are eager for a share of the spoil. Already a host of the elves\\r\\nis on the way, and carrion birds are with them hoping for battle and slaughter. By\\r\\nthe lake men murmur that their sorrows are due to the dwarves; for they are\\r\\nhomeless and many have died, and Smaug has destroyed their town. They too\\r\\nthink to find amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or dead.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour own wisdom must decide your course; but thirteen is small remnant of\\r\\nthe great folk of Durin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far. If you\\r\\nwill listen to my counsel, you will not trust the Master of the Lake-men, but\\r\\nrather him that shot the dragon with his bow. Bard is he, of the race of Dale, of\\r\\nthe line of Girion; he is a grim man but true. We would see peace once more\\r\\namong dwarves and men and elves after the long desolation; but it may cost you\\r\\ndear in gold. I have spoken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then Thorin burst forth in anger: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur thanks, Ro\\xc3\\xa4c Carc\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son. You and\\r\\nyour people shall not be forgotten. But none of our gold shall thieves take or the\\r\\nviolent carry off while we are alive. If you would earn our thanks still more,\\r\\nbring us news of any that draw near. Also I would beg of you, if any of you are\\r\\nstill young and strong of wing, that you would send messengers to our kin in the\\r\\nmountains of the North, both west from here and east, and tell them of our\\r\\nplight. But go specially to my cousin Dain in the Iron Hills, for he has many\\r\\npeople well-armed, and dwells nearest to this place. Bid him hasten!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not say if this counsel be good or bad,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d croaked Ro\\xc3\\xa4c, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I will do\\r\\nwhat can be done.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then off he slowly flew.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBack now to the Mountain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have little time to lose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd little food to use!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bilbo, always practical on such points. In any\\r\\ncase he felt that the adventure was, properly speaking, over with the death of the\\r\\ndragon\\xe2\\x80\\x94in which he was much mistaken\\xe2\\x80\\x94and he would have given most of his\\r\\nshare of the profits for the peaceful winding up of these affairs.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBack to the Mountain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the dwarves as if they had not heard him; so\\r\\nback he had to go with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you have heard some of the events already, you will see that the dwarves still\\r\\nhad some days before them. They explored the caverns once more, and found, as\\r\\n\\x0cthey expected, that only the Front Gate remained open; all the other gates\\r\\n(except, of course, the small secret door) had long ago been broken and blocked\\r\\nby Smaug, and no sign of them remained. So now they began to labour hard in\\r\\nfortifying the main entrance, and in making a new path that led from it. Tools\\r\\nwere to be found in plenty that the miners and quarriers and builders of old had\\r\\nused; and at such work the dwarves were still very skilled.\\r\\n    As they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings. In this way they\\r\\nlearned that the Elvenking had turned aside to the Lake, and they still had a\\r\\nbreathing space. Better still, they heard that three of their ponies had escaped and\\r\\nwere wandering wild far down the banks of the Running River, not far from\\r\\nwhere the rest of their stores had been left. So while the others went on with\\r\\ntheir work, Fili and Kili were sent, guided by a raven, to find the ponies and\\r\\nbring back all they could.\\r\\n    They were four days gone, and by that time they knew that the joined armies\\r\\nof the Lake-men and the Elves were hurrying toward the Mountain. But now\\r\\ntheir hopes were higher; for they had food for some weeks with care\\xe2\\x80\\x94chiefly\\r\\ncram, of course, and they were very tired of it; but cram is much better than\\r\\nnothing\\xe2\\x80\\x94and already the gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid\\r\\ndry, but very thick and high, across the opening. There were holes in the wall\\r\\nthrough which they could see (or shoot), but no entrance. They climbed in or out\\r\\nwith ladders, and hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the stream they\\r\\nhad contrived a small low arch under the new wall; but near the entrance they\\r\\nhad so altered the narrow bed that a wide pool stretched from the mountain-wall\\r\\nto the head of the fall over which the stream went towards Dale. Approach to the\\r\\nGate was now only possible, without swimming, along a narrow ledge of the\\r\\ncliff, to the right as one looked outwards from the wall. The ponies they had\\r\\nbrought only to the head of the steps above the old bridge, and unloading them\\r\\nthere had bidden them return to their masters and sent them back riderless to the\\r\\nSouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere came a night when suddenly there were many lights as of fires and torches\\r\\naway south in Dale before them.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey have come!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d called Balin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd their camp is very great. They must\\r\\nhave come into the valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   That night the dwarves slept little. The morning was still pale when they saw\\r\\na company approaching. From behind their wall they watched them come up to\\r\\n\\x0cthe valley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head and climb slowly up. Before long they could see that both men\\r\\nof the lake armed as if for war and elvish bowmen were among them. At length\\r\\nthe foremost of these climbed the tumbled rocks and appeared at the top of the\\r\\nfalls; and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate\\r\\nblocked with a wall of new-hewn stone.\\r\\n     As they stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed them:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called in a very loud voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat come as if in war to the\\r\\ngates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what do you\\r\\ndesire?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     But they answered nothing. Some turned swiftly back, and the others after\\r\\ngazing for a while at the Gate and its defences soon followed them. That day the\\r\\ncamp was moved to the east of the river, right between the arms of the Mountain.\\r\\nThe rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not done for many\\r\\na day. There was the sound, too, of elven-harps and of sweet music; and as it\\r\\nechoed up towards them it seemed that the chill of the air was warmed, and they\\r\\ncaught faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring.\\r\\n     Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join\\r\\nin the mirth and feasting by the fires. Some of the younger dwarves were moved\\r\\nin their hearts, too, and they muttered that they wished things had fallen out\\r\\notherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends; but Thorin scowled.\\r\\n     Then the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and instruments regained\\r\\nfrom the hoard, and made music to soften his mood; but their song was not as\\r\\nelvish song, and was much like the song they had sung long before in Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlittle hobbit-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Under the Mountain dark and tall\\r\\n       The King has come unto his hall!\\r\\n       His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,\\r\\n       And ever so his foes shall fall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The sword is sharp, the spear is long,\\r\\n       The arrow swift, the Gate is strong;\\r\\n       The heart is bold that looks on gold;\\r\\n       The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.\\r\\n\\x0c       The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,\\r\\n       While hammers fell like ringing bells\\r\\n       In places deep, where dark things sleep,\\r\\n       In hollow halls beneath the fells.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       On silver necklaces they strung\\r\\n       The light of stars, on crowns they hung\\r\\n       The dragon-fire, from twisted wire\\r\\n       The melody of harps they wrung.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The mountain throne once more is freed!\\r\\n       O! wandering folk, the summons heed!\\r\\n       Come haste! Come haste! across the waste!\\r\\n       The king of friend and kin has need.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Now call we over mountains cold,\\r\\n       \\xe2\\x80\\x98Come back unto the caverns old\\xe2\\x80\\x99!\\r\\n       Here at the Gates the king awaits,\\r\\n       His hands are rich with gems and gold.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The king is come unto his hall\\r\\n       Under the Mountain dark and tall.\\r\\n       The Worm of Dread is slain and dead,\\r\\n       And ever so our foes shall fall!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   This song appeared to please Thorin, and he smiled again and grew merry;\\r\\nand he began reckoning the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be\\r\\nbefore Dain could reach the Lonely Mountain, if he had set out as soon as the\\r\\nmessage reached him. But Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart fell, both at the song and the talk: they\\r\\nsounded much too warlike.\\r\\n   The next morning early a company of spearmen was seen crossing the river,\\r\\nand marching up the valley. They bore with them the green banner of the\\r\\nElvenking and the blue banner of the Lake, and they advanced until they stood\\r\\nright before the wall at the Gate.\\r\\n\\x0c    Again Thorin hailed them in a loud voice: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you that come armed for\\r\\nwar to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This time\\r\\nhe was answered.\\r\\n    A tall man stood forward, dark of hair and grim of face, and he cried: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHail\\r\\nThorin! Why do you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? We are not yet\\r\\nfoes, and we rejoice that you are alive beyond our hope. We came expecting to\\r\\nfind none living here; yet now that we are met there is matter for a parley and a\\r\\ncouncil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you, and of what would you parley?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure\\r\\ndelivered. Is that not a matter that concerns you? Moreover I am by right descent\\r\\nthe heir of Girion of Dale, and in your hoard is mingled much of the wealth of\\r\\nhis halls and towns, which of old Smaug stole. Is not that a matter of which we\\r\\nmay speak? Further in his last battle Smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men\\r\\nof Esgaroth, and I am yet the servant of their Master. I would speak for him and\\r\\nask whether you have no thought for the sorrow and misery of his people. They\\r\\naided you in your distress, and in recompense you have thus far brought ruin\\r\\nonly, though doubtless undesigned.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Now these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and Bilbo\\r\\nthought that Thorin would at once admit what justice was in them. He did not, of\\r\\ncourse, expect that any one would remember that it was he who discovered all\\r\\nby himself the dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weak spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever did.\\r\\nBut also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has\\r\\nlong brooded, nor with dwarvish hearts. Long hours in the past days Thorin had\\r\\nspent in the treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. Though he had hunted\\r\\nchiefly for the Arkenstone, yet he had an eye for many another wonderful thing\\r\\nthat was lying there, about which were wound old memories of the labours and\\r\\nthe sorrows of his race.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou put your worst cause last and in the chief place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thorin answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo\\r\\nthe treasure of my people no man has a claim, because Smaug who stole it from\\r\\nus also robbed him of life or home. The treasure was not his that his evil deeds\\r\\nshould be amended with a share of it. The price of the goods and the assistance\\r\\nthat we received of the Lake-men we will fairly pay\\xe2\\x80\\x94in due time. But nothing\\r\\nwill we give, not even a loaf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth, under threat of force. While an armed host\\r\\nlies before our doors, we look on you as foes and thieves.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid\\r\\nto our kindred, had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA just question,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Bard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut you are not dead, and we are not\\r\\nrobbers. Moreover the wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy that\\r\\nbefriended them when they were in want. And still my other claims remain\\r\\nunanswered.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will not parley, as I have said, with armed men at my gate. Nor at all with\\r\\nthe people of the Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness. In this\\r\\ndebate they have no place. Begone now ere our arrows fly! And if you would\\r\\nspeak with me again, first dismiss the elvish host to the woods where it belongs,\\r\\nand then return, laying down your arms before you approach the threshold.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Elvenking is my friend, and he has succoured the people of the Lake in\\r\\ntheir need, though they had no claim but friendship on him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Bard.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will give you time to repent your words. Gather your wisdom ere we\\r\\nreturn!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then he departed and went back to the camp.\\r\\n    Ere many hours were past, the banner-bearers returned, and trumpeters stood\\r\\nforth and blew a blast:\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the name of Esgaroth and the Forest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe speak unto Thorin\\r\\nThrain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son Oakenshield, calling himself the King under the Mountain, and we\\r\\nbid him consider well the claims that have been urged, or be declared our foe. At\\r\\nthe least he shall deliver one twelfth portion of the treasure unto Bard, as the\\r\\ndragon-slayer, and as the heir of Girion. From that portion Bard will himself\\r\\ncontribute to the aid of Esgaroth; but if Thorin would have the friendship and\\r\\nhonour of the lands about, as his sires had of old, then he will give also\\r\\nsomewhat of his own for the comfort of the men of the Lake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then Thorin seized a bow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker. It smote\\r\\ninto his shield and stuck there quivering.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince such is your answer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called in return, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI declare the Mountain\\r\\nbesieged. You shall not depart from it, until you call on your side for a truce and\\r\\na parley. We will bear no weapons against you, but we leave you to your gold.\\r\\nYou may eat that, if you will!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    With that the messengers departed swiftly, and the dwarves were left to\\r\\nconsider their case. So grim had Thorin become, that even if they had wished,\\r\\nthe others would not have dared to find fault with him; but indeed most of them\\r\\nseemed to share his mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94except perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili and Kili.\\r\\nBilbo, of course, disapproved of the whole turn of affairs. He had by now had\\r\\nmore than enough of the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was not at all to\\r\\nhis taste.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe whole place still stinks of dragon,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he grumbled to himself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand it\\r\\n\\x0cmakes me sick. And cram is beginning simply to stick in my throat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0cChapter XVI\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA THIEF IN THE NIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time\\r\\npiling and ordering the treasure; and now Thorin spoke of the Arkenstone of\\r\\nThrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in every corner.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the Arkenstone of my father,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis worth more than a river of\\r\\ngold in itself, and to me it is beyond price. That stone of all the treasure I name\\r\\nunto myself, and I will be avenged on anyone who finds it and withholds it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Bilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen,\\r\\nif the stone was found\\xe2\\x80\\x94wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he\\r\\nused as a pillow. All the same he did not speak of it, for as the weariness of the\\r\\ndays grew heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his little head.\\r\\n    Things had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought news\\r\\nthat Dain and more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron Hills,\\r\\nwere now within about two days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 march of Dale, coming from the North-East.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut they cannot reach the Mountain unmarked,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ro\\xc3\\xa4c, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I fear lest\\r\\nthere be battle in the valley. I do not call this counsel good. Though they are a\\r\\ngrim folk, they are not likely to overcome the host that besets you; and even if\\r\\nthey did so, what will you gain? Winter and snow is hastening behind them. How\\r\\nshall you be fed without the friendship and goodwill of the lands about you? The\\r\\ntreasure is likely to be your death, though the dragon is no more!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    But Thorin was not moved. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWinter and snow will bite both men and elves,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand they may find their dwelling in the waste grievous to bear. With my\\r\\nfriends behind them and winter upon them, they will perhaps be in softer mood\\r\\nto parley with.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    That night Bilbo made up his mind. The sky was black and moonless. As\\r\\nsoon as it was full dark, he went to a corner of an inner chamber just within the\\r\\n\\x0cgate and drew from his bundle a rope, and also the Arkenstone wrapped in a rag.\\r\\nThen he climbed to the top of the wall. Only Bombur was there, for it was his\\r\\nturn to watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a time.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is mighty cold!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bombur. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish we could have a fire up here as\\r\\nthey have in the camp!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is warm enough inside,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI daresay; but I am bound here till midnight,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grumbled the fat dwarf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\r\\nsorry business altogether. Not that I venture to disagree with Thorin, may his\\r\\nbeard grow ever longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff neck.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot as stiff as my legs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am tired of stairs and stone passages.\\r\\nI would give a good deal for the feel of grass at my toes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would give a good deal for the feel of a strong drink in my throat, and for a\\r\\nsoft bed after a good supper!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give you those, while the siege is going on. But it is long since I\\r\\nwatched, and I will take your turn for you, if you like. There is no sleep in me\\r\\ntonight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are a good fellow, Mr. Baggins, and I will take your offer kindly. If\\r\\nthere should be anything to note, rouse me first, mind you! I will lie in the inner\\r\\nchamber to the left, not far away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOff you go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will wake you at midnight, and you can wake the\\r\\nnext watchman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    As soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on his ring, fastened his rope,\\r\\nslipped down over the wall, and was gone. He had about five hours before him.\\r\\nBombur would sleep (he could sleep at any time, and ever since the adventure in\\r\\nthe forest he was always trying to recapture the beautiful dreams he had then);\\r\\nand all the others were busy with Thorin. It was unlikely that any, even Fili or\\r\\nKili, would come out on the wall until it was their turn.\\r\\n    It was very dark, and the road after a while, when he left the newly made path\\r\\nand climbed down towards the lower course of the stream, was strange to him.\\r\\nAt last he came to the bend where he had to cross the water, if he was to make\\r\\nfor the camp, as he wished. The bed of the stream was there shallow but already\\r\\nbroad, and fording it in the dark was not easy for the little hobbit. He was nearly\\r\\nacross when he missed his footing on a round stone and fell into the cold water\\r\\nwith a splash. He had barely scrambled out on the far bank, shivering and\\r\\nspluttering, when up came elves in the gloom with bright lanterns and searched\\r\\nfor the cause of the noise.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat was no fish!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a spy about. Hide your lights! They\\r\\n\\x0cwill help him more than us, if it is that queer little creature that is said to be their\\r\\nservant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cServant, indeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d snorted Bilbo; and in the middle of his snort he sneezed\\r\\nloudly, and the elves immediately gathered towards the sound.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have a light!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am here, if you want me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he slipped off\\r\\nhis ring, and popped from behind a rock.\\r\\n    They seized him quickly, in spite of their surprise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you? Are you\\r\\nthe dwarves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 hobbit? What are you doing? How did you get so far past our\\r\\nsentinels?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they asked one after another.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am Mr. Bilbo Baggins,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompanion of Thorin, if you want\\r\\nto know. I know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know me to\\r\\nlook at. But Bard will remember me, and it is Bard I particularly want to see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said they, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand what may be your business?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever it is, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my own, my good elves. But if you wish ever to get back\\r\\nto your own woods from this cold cheerless place,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered shivering, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\r\\nwill take me along quick to a fire, where I can dry\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then you will let me\\r\\nspeak to your chiefs as quick as may be. I have only an hour or two to spare.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is how it came about that some two hours after his escape from the Gate,\\r\\nBilbo was sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent, and there sat too,\\r\\ngazing curiously at him, both the Elvenking and Bard. A hobbit in elvish armour,\\r\\npartly wrapped in an old blanket, was something new to them.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReally you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bilbo was saying in his best business manner, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthings are\\r\\nimpossible. Personally I am tired of the whole affair. I wish I was back in the\\r\\nWest in my own home, where folk are more reasonable. But I have an interest in\\r\\nthis matter\\xe2\\x80\\x94one fourteenth share, to be precise, according to a letter, which\\r\\nfortunately I believe I have kept.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He drew from a pocket in his old jacket\\r\\n(which he still wore over his mail), crumpled and much folded, Thorin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s letter\\r\\nthat had been put under the clock on his mantelpiece in May!\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA share in the profits, mind you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he went on. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am aware of that.\\r\\nPersonally I am only too ready to consider all your claims carefully, and deduct\\r\\nwhat is right from the total before putting in my own claim. However you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nknow Thorin Oakenshield as well as I do now. I assure you, he is quite ready to\\r\\nsit on a heap of gold and starve, as long as you sit here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, let him!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch a fool deserves to starve.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuite so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see your point of view. At the same time winter is\\r\\n\\x0ccoming on fast. Before long you will be having snow and what not, and supplies\\r\\nwill be difficult\\xe2\\x80\\x94even for elves I imagine. Also there will be other difficulties.\\r\\nYou have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of the Iron Hills?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have, a long time ago; but what has he got to do with us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the\\r\\nking.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought as much. I see I have some information you have not got. Dain, I\\r\\nmay tell you, is now less than two days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 march off, and has at least five hundred\\r\\ngrim dwarves with him\\xe2\\x80\\x94a good many of them have had experience in the\\r\\ndreadful dwarf and goblin wars, of which you have no doubt heard. When they\\r\\narrive there may be serious trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy do you tell us this? Are you betraying your friends, or are you\\r\\nthreatening us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bard grimly.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Bard!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d squeaked Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be so hasty! I never met such\\r\\nsuspicious folk! I am merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned. Now I\\r\\nwill make you an offer! !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us hear it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou may see it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is this!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he drew forth the Arkenstone, and\\r\\nthrew away the wrapping.\\r\\n    The Elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and\\r\\nbeauty, stood up in amazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. It\\r\\nwas as if a globe had been filled with moonlight and hung before them in a net\\r\\nwoven of the glint of frosty stars.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is the Arkenstone of Thrain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Heart of the Mountain;\\r\\nand it is also the heart of Thorin. He values it above a river of gold. I give it to\\r\\nyou. It will aid you in your bargaining.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then Bilbo, not without a shudder, not\\r\\nwithout a glance of longing, handed the marvellous stone to Bard, and he held it\\r\\nin his hand, as though dazed.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut how is it yours to give?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked at last with an effort.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO well!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the hobbit uncomfortably. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exactly; but, well, I am\\r\\nwilling to let it stand against all my claim, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you know. I may be a burglar\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nor so they say: personally I never really felt like one\\xe2\\x80\\x94but I am an honest one, I\\r\\nhope, more or less. Anyway I am going back now, and the dwarves can do what\\r\\nthey like to me. I hope you will find it useful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The Elvenking looked at Bilbo with a new wonder. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBilbo Baggins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are more worthy to wear the armour of elf-princes than many that have\\r\\nlooked more comely in it. But I wonder if Thorin Oakenshield will see it so. I\\r\\nhave more knowledge of dwarves in general than you have perhaps. I advise you\\r\\n\\x0cto remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and thrice welcome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you very much I am sure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo with a bow. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\r\\nought to leave my friends like this, after all we have gone through together. And\\r\\nI promised to wake old Bombur at midnight, too! Really I must be going, and\\r\\nquickly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Nothing they could say would stop him; so an escort was provided for him,\\r\\nand as he went both the king and Bard saluted him with honour. As they passed\\r\\nthrough the camp an old man, wrapped in a dark cloak, rose from a tent door\\r\\nwhere he was sitting and came towards them.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell done! Mr. Baggins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, clapping Bilbo on the back. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is\\r\\nalways more about you than anyone expects!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was Gandalf.\\r\\n    For the first time for many a day Bilbo was really delighted. But there was no\\r\\ntime for all the questions that he immediately wished to ask.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll in good time!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThings are drawing towards the end now,\\r\\nunless I am mistaken. There is an unpleasant time just in front of you; but keep\\r\\nyour heart up! You may come through all right. There is news brewing that even\\r\\nthe ravens have not heard. Good night!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Puzzled but cheered, Bilbo hurried on. He was guided to a safe ford and set\\r\\nacross dry, and then he said farewell to the elves and climbed carefully back\\r\\ntowards the Gate. Great weariness began to come over him; but it was well\\r\\nbefore midnight when he clambered up the rope again\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was still where he had\\r\\nleft it. He untied it and hid it, and then he sat down on the wall and wondered\\r\\nanxiously what would happen next.\\r\\n    At midnight he woke up Bombur; and then in turn rolled himself up in his\\r\\ncorner, without listening to the old dwarf\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thanks (which he felt he had hardly\\r\\nearned). He was soon fast asleep forgetting all his worries till the morning. As a\\r\\nmatter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and bacon.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter XVII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CLOUDS BURST\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day the trumpets rang early in the camp. Soon a single runner was seen\\r\\nhurrying along the narrow path. At a distance he stood and hailed them, asking\\r\\nwhether Thorin would now listen to another embassy, since new tidings had\\r\\ncome to hand, and matters were changed.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat will be Dain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin when he heard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey will have got wind of\\r\\nhis coming. I thought that would alter their mood! Bid them come few in number\\r\\nand weaponless, and I will hear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called to the messenger.\\r\\n    About midday the banners of the Forest and the Lake were seen to be borne\\r\\nforth again. A company of twenty was approaching. At the beginning of the\\r\\nnarrow way they laid aside sword and spear, and came on towards the Gate.\\r\\nWondering, the dwarves saw that among them were both Bard and the\\r\\nElvenking, before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong\\r\\ncasket of iron-bound wood.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHail Thorin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you still of the same mind?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy mind does not change with the rising and setting of a few suns,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nanswered Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you come to ask me idle questions? Still the elf-host has\\r\\nnot departed as I bade! Till then you come in vain to bargain with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs there then nothing for which you would yield any of your gold?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing that you or your friends have to offer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat of the Arkenstone of Thrain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, and at the same moment the\\r\\nold man opened the casket and held aloft the jewel. The light leapt from his\\r\\nhand, bright and white in the morning.\\r\\n    Then Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. No one\\r\\nspoke for a long while.\\r\\n    Thorin at length broke the silence, and his voice was thick with wrath. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\r\\n\\x0cstone was my father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, and is mine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy should I purchase my own?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nBut wonder overcame him and he added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut how came you by the heirloom of\\r\\nmy house\\xe2\\x80\\x94if there is need to ask such a question of thieves?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are not thieves,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bard answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYour own we will give back in return\\r\\nfor our own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow came you by it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted Thorin in gathering rage.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI gave it to them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d squeaked Bilbo, who was peering over the wall, by now\\r\\nin a dreadful fright.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou! You!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Thorin, turning upon him and grasping him with both\\r\\nhands. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou miserable hobbit! You undersized\\xe2\\x80\\x94burglar!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted at a loss\\r\\nfor words, and he shook poor Bilbo like a rabbit.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse him for his choice\\r\\nof you! May his beard wither! As for you I will throw you to the rocks!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried\\r\\nand lifted Bilbo in his arms.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStay! Your wish is granted!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a voice. The old man with the casket threw\\r\\naside his hood and cloak. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHere is Gandalf! And none too soon it seems. If you\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like my Burglar, please don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t damage him. Put him down, and listen first to\\r\\nwhat he has to say!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou all seem in league!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin dropping Bilbo on the top of the wall.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever again will I have dealings with any wizard or his friends. What have you\\r\\nto say, you descendant of rats?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear me! Dear me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sure this is all very uncomfortable.\\r\\nYou may remember saying that I might choose my own fourteenth share?\\r\\nPerhaps I took it too literally\\xe2\\x80\\x94I have been told that dwarves are sometimes\\r\\npoliter in word than in deed. The time was, all the same, when you seemed to\\r\\nthink that I had been of some service. Descendant of rats, indeed! Is this all the\\r\\nservice of you and your family that I was promised, Thorin? Take it that I have\\r\\ndisposed of my share as I wished, and let it go at that!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin grimly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I will let you go at that\\xe2\\x80\\x94and may we\\r\\nnever meet again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Then he turned and spoke over the wall. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am betrayed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was rightly guessed that I could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone,\\r\\nthe treasure of my house. For it I will give one fourteenth share of the hoard in\\r\\nsilver and gold, setting aside the gems; but that shall be accounted the promised\\r\\nshare of this traitor, and with that reward he shall depart, and you can divide it as\\r\\nyou will. He will get little enough, I doubt not. Take him, if you wish him to live;\\r\\nand no friendship of mine goes with him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet down now to your friends!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor I will throw you\\r\\n\\x0cdown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat about the gold and silver?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat shall follow after, as can be arranged,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet down!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUntil then we keep the stone,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bard.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nsaid Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut things may change yet.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey may indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. And already, so strong was the\\r\\nbewilderment of the treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of\\r\\nDain he might not recapture the Arkenstone and withhold the share of the\\r\\nreward.\\r\\n    And so Bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for\\r\\nall his trouble, except the armour which Thorin had given him already. More\\r\\nthan one of the dwarves in their hearts felt shame and pity at his going.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarewell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried to them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe may meet again as friends.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe off!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d called Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have mail upon you, which was made by my\\r\\nfolk, and is too good for you. It cannot be pierced by arrows; but if you do not\\r\\nhasten, I will sting your miserable feet. So be swift!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot so hasty!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will give you until tomorrow. At noon we\\r\\nwill return, and see if you have brought from the hoard the portion that is to be\\r\\nset against the stone. If that is done without deceit, then we will depart, and the\\r\\nelf-host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    With that they went back to the camp; but Thorin sent messengers by Ro\\xc3\\xa4c\\r\\ntelling Dain of what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the air\\r\\nwas dark and gloomy. The morning was still early when a cry was heard in the\\r\\ncamp. Runners came in to report that a host of dwarves had appeared round the\\r\\neastern spur of the Mountain and was now hastening to Dale. Dain had come. He\\r\\nhad hurried on through the night, and so had come upon them sooner than they\\r\\nhad expected. Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung\\r\\nto his knees, and his legs were covered with hose of a fine and flexible metal\\r\\nmesh, the secret of whose making was possessed by Dain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s people. The dwarves\\r\\nare exceedingly strong for their height, but most of these were strong even for\\r\\ndwarves. In battle they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but each of them\\r\\nhad also a short broad sword at his side and a roundshield slung at his back.\\r\\nTheir beards were forked and plaited and thrust into their belts. Their caps were\\r\\n\\x0cof iron and they were shod with iron, and their faces were grim.\\r\\n    Trumpets called men and elves to arms. Before long the dwarves could be\\r\\nseen coming up the valley at a great pace. They halted between the river and the\\r\\neastern spur; but a few held on their way, and crossing the river drew near the\\r\\ncamp; and there they laid down their weapons and held up their hands in sign of\\r\\npeace. Bard went out to meet them, and with him went Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are sent from Dain son of Nain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said when questioned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are\\r\\nhastening to our kinsmen in the Mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of\\r\\nold is renewed. But who are you that sit in the plain as foes before defended\\r\\nwalls?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This, of course, in the polite and rather old-fashioned language of such\\r\\noccasions, meant simply: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have no business here. We are going on, so make\\r\\nway or we shall fight you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They meant to push on between the Mountain and\\r\\nthe loop of the river; for the narrow land there did not seem to be strongly\\r\\nguarded.\\r\\n    Bard, of course, refused to allow the dwarves to go straight on to the\\r\\nMountain. He was determined to wait until the gold and silver had been brought\\r\\nout in exchange for the Arkenstone; for he did not believe that this would be\\r\\ndone, if once the fortress was manned with so large and warlike a company.\\r\\nThey had brought with them a great store of supplies; for the dwarves can carry\\r\\nvery heavy burdens, and nearly all of Dain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s folk, in spite of their rapid march,\\r\\nbore huge packs on their backs in addition to their weapons. They would stand a\\r\\nsiege for weeks, and by that time yet more dwarves might come, and yet more,\\r\\nfor Thorin had many relatives. Also they would be able to reopen and guard\\r\\nsome other gate, so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole\\r\\nmountain; and for that they had not sufficient numbers.\\r\\n    These were, in fact, precisely their plans (for the raven-messengers had been\\r\\nbusy between Thorin and Dain); but for the moment the way was barred, so after\\r\\nangry words the dwarf-messengers retired muttering in their beards. Bard then\\r\\nsent messengers at once to the Gate; but they found no gold or payment. Arrows\\r\\ncame forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay.\\r\\nIn the camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the dwarves of Dain were\\r\\nadvancing along the eastern bank.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFools!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d laughed Bard, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto come thus beneath the Mountain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm! They do\\r\\nnot understand war above ground, whatever they may know of battle in the\\r\\nmines. There are many of our archers and spearmen now hidden in the rocks\\r\\nupon their right flank. Dwarf-mail may be good, but they will soon be hard put\\r\\nto it. Let us set on them now from both sides, before they are fully rested!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\x0c    But the Elvenking said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLong will I tarry, ere I begin this war for gold. The\\r\\ndwarves cannot pass us, unless we will, or do anything that we cannot mark. Let\\r\\nus hope still for something that will bring reconciliation. Our advantage in\\r\\nnumbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy blows.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    But he reckoned without the dwarves. The knowledge that the Arkenstone\\r\\nwas in the hands of the besiegers burned in their thoughts; also they guessed the\\r\\nhesitation of Bard and his friends, and resolved to strike while they debated.\\r\\n    Suddenly without a signal they sprang silently forward to attack. Bows\\r\\ntwanged and arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined.\\r\\n    Still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! A black\\r\\ncloud hurried over the sky. Winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and\\r\\nrumbled in the Mountain, and lightning lit its peak. And beneath the thunder\\r\\nanother blackness could be seen whirling forward; but it did not come with the\\r\\nwind, it came from the North, like a vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light\\r\\ncould be seen between their wings.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHalt!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with arms\\r\\nuplifted, between the advancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHalt!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe called in a voice like thunder, and his staff blazed forth with a flash like the\\r\\nlightning. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDread has come upon you all! Alas! it has come more swiftly than I\\r\\nguessed. The Goblins are upon you! Bolg* of the North is coming, O Dain!\\r\\nwhose father you slew in Moria. Behold! the bats are above his army like a sea\\r\\nof locusts. They ride upon wolves and Wargs are in their train!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Amazement and confusion fell upon them all. Even as Gandalf had been\\r\\nspeaking the darkness grew. The dwarves halted and gazed at the sky. The elves\\r\\ncried out with many voices.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d called Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is yet time for council. Let Dain son of Nain\\r\\ncome swiftly to us!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the Battle of Five\\r\\nArmies, and it was very terrible. Upon one side were the Goblins and the Wild\\r\\nWolves, and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This is how it fell\\r\\nout. Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty Mountains the hatred of\\r\\ntheir race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury. Messengers had passed to\\r\\nand fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now\\r\\nto win the dominion of the North. Tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and\\r\\n\\x0cin all the mountains there was a forging and an arming. Then they marched and\\r\\ngathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark, until around and\\r\\nbeneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was their capital, a\\r\\nvast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares upon\\r\\nthe South. Then they learned of the death of Smaug, and joy was in their hearts;\\r\\nand they hastened night after night through the mountains, and came thus at last\\r\\non a sudden from the North hard on the heels of Dain. Not even the ravens knew\\r\\nof their coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the Lonely\\r\\nMountain from the hills behind. How much Gandalf knew cannot be said, but it\\r\\nis plain that he had not expected this sudden assault.\\r\\n    This is the plan that he made in council with the Elven-king and with Bard;\\r\\nand with Dain, for the dwarf-lord now joined them: the Goblins were the foes of\\r\\nall, and at their coming all other quarrels were forgotten. Their only hope was to\\r\\nlure the goblins into the valley between the arms of the Mountain; and\\r\\nthemselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east. Yet this would be\\r\\nperilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain itself,\\r\\nand so attack them also from behind and above; but there was no time to make\\r\\nany other plan, or to summon any help.\\r\\n    Soon the thunder passed, rolling away to the South-East; but the bat-cloud\\r\\ncame, flying lower, over the shoulder of the Mountain, and whirled above them\\r\\nshutting out the light and filling them with dread.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo the Mountain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d called Bard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo the Mountain! Let us take our places\\r\\nwhile there is yet time!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    On the Southern spur, in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the Elves\\r\\nwere set; on the Eastern spur were men and dwarves. But Bard and some of the\\r\\nnimblest of men and elves climbed to the height of the Eastern shoulder to gain a\\r\\nview to the North. Soon they could see the lands before the Mountain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feet\\r\\nblack with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nend and came rushing into Dale. These were the swiftest wolf-riders, and already\\r\\ntheir cries and howls rent the air afar. A few brave men were strung before them\\r\\nto make a feint of resistance, and many there fell before the rest drew back and\\r\\nfled to either side. As Gandalf had hoped, the goblin army had gathered behind\\r\\nthe resisted vanguard, and poured now in rage into the valley, driving wildly up\\r\\nbetween the arms of the Mountain, seeking for the foe. Their banners were\\r\\ncountless, black and red, and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder.\\r\\n    It was a terrible battle. The most dreadful of all Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiences, and the\\r\\none which at the time he hated most\\xe2\\x80\\x94which is to say it was the one he was most\\r\\n\\x0cproud of, and most fond of recalling long afterwards, although he was quite\\r\\nunimportant in it. Actually I may say he put on his ring early in the business, and\\r\\nvanished from sight, if not from all danger. A magic ring of that sort is not a\\r\\ncomplete protection in a goblin charge, nor does it stop flying arrows and wild\\r\\nspears; but it does help in getting out of the way, and it prevents your head from\\r\\nbeing specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman.\\r\\n    The elves were the first to charge. Their hatred for the goblins is cold and\\r\\nbitter. Their spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame,\\r\\nso deadly was the wrath of the hands that held them. As soon as the host of their\\r\\nenemies was dense in the valley, they sent against it a shower of arrows, and\\r\\neach flickered as it fled as if with stinging fire. Behind the arrows a thousand of\\r\\ntheir spearmen leapt down and charged. The yells were deafening. The rocks\\r\\nwere stained black with goblin blood.\\r\\n    Just as the goblins were recovering from the onslaught and the elf-charge was\\r\\nhalted, there rose from across the valley a deep-throated roar. With cries of\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMoria!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDain, Dain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the dwarves of the Iron Hills plunged in, wielding\\r\\ntheir mattocks, upon the other side; and beside them came the men of the Lake\\r\\nwith long swords.\\r\\n    Panic came upon the Goblins; and even as they turned to meet this new\\r\\nattack, the elves charged again with renewed numbers. Already many of the\\r\\ngoblins were flying back down the river to escape from the trap; and many of\\r\\ntheir own wolves were turning upon them and rending the dead and the\\r\\nwounded. Victory seemed at hand, when a cry rang out on the heights above.\\r\\n    Goblins had scaled the Mountain from the other side and already many were\\r\\non the slopes above the Gate, and others were streaming down recklessly,\\r\\nheedless of those that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to attack the spurs\\r\\nfrom above. Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down from the\\r\\nmain mass of the Mountain in the centre; and the defenders had too few to bar\\r\\nthe way for long. Victory now vanished from hope. They had only stemmed the\\r\\nfirst onslaught of the black tide.\\r\\n    Day drew on. The goblins gathered again in the valley. There a host of Wargs\\r\\ncame ravening and with them came the bodyguard of Bolg, goblins of huge size\\r\\nwith scimitars of steel. Soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky;\\r\\nwhile still the great bats swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men, or\\r\\nfastened vampire-like on the stricken. Now Bard was fighting to defend the\\r\\nEastern spur, and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords were at bay about\\r\\ntheir king upon the southern arm, near to the watch-post on Ravenhill.\\r\\n\\x0c    Suddenly there was a great shout, and from the Gate came a trumpet call.\\r\\nThey had forgotten Thorin! Part of the wall, moved by levers, fell outward with\\r\\na crash into the pool. Out leapt the King under the Mountain, and his\\r\\ncompanions followed him. Hood and cloak were gone; they were in shining\\r\\narmour, and red light leapt from their eyes. In the gloom the great dwarf gleamed\\r\\nlike gold in a dying fire.\\r\\n    Rocks were hurled down from on high by the goblins above; but they held\\r\\non, leapt down to the falls\\xe2\\x80\\x99 foot, and rushed forward to battle. Wolf and rider fell\\r\\nor fled before them. Thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing\\r\\nseemed to harm him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O my kinsfolk!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, and his\\r\\nvoice shook like a horn in the valley.\\r\\n    Down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of Dain to his help. Down\\r\\ntoo came many of the Lake-men, for Bard could not restrain them; and out upon\\r\\nthe other side came many of the spearmen of the elves. Once again the goblins\\r\\nwere stricken in the valley; and they were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and\\r\\nhideous with their corpses. The Wargs were scattered and Thorin drove right\\r\\nagainst the bodyguard of Bolg. But he could not pierce their ranks.\\r\\n    Already behind him among the goblin dead lay many men and many\\r\\ndwarves, and many a fair elf that should have lived yet long ages merrily in the\\r\\nwood. And as the valley widened his onset grew ever slower. His numbers were\\r\\ntoo few. His flanks were unguarded. Soon the attackers were attacked, and they\\r\\nwere forced into a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins\\r\\nand wolves returning to the assault. The bodyguard of Bolg came howling\\r\\nagainst them, and drove in upon their ranks like waves upon cliffs of sand. Their\\r\\nfriends could not help them, for the assault from the Mountain was renewed with\\r\\nredoubled force, and upon either side men and elves were being slowly beaten\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n    On all this Bilbo looked with misery. He had taken his stand on Ravenhill\\r\\namong the Elves\\xe2\\x80\\x94partly because there was more chance of escape from that\\r\\npoint, and partly (with the more Tookish part of his mind) because if he was\\r\\ngoing to be in a last desperate stand, he preferred on the whole to defend the\\r\\nElvenking. Gandalf, too, I may say, was there, sitting on the ground as if in deep\\r\\nthought, preparing, I suppose, some last blast of magic before the end.\\r\\n    That did not seem far off. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will not be long now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbefore\\r\\nthe goblins win the Gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and\\r\\ncaptured. Really it is enough to make one weep, after all one has gone through. I\\r\\n\\x0cwould rather old Smaug had been left with all the wretched treasure, than that\\r\\nthese vile creatures should get it, and poor old Bombur, and Balin and Fili and\\r\\nKili and all the rest come to a bad end; and Bard too, and the Lake-men and the\\r\\nmerry elves. Misery me! I have heard songs of many battles, and I have always\\r\\nunderstood that defeat may be glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not to say\\r\\ndistressing. I wish I was well out of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    The clouds were torn by the wind, and a red sunset slashed the West. Seeing\\r\\nthe sudden gleam in the gloom Bilbo looked round. He gave a great cry: he had\\r\\nseen a sight that made his heart leap, dark shapes small yet majestic against the\\r\\ndistant glow.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Eagles! The Eagles!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Eagles are coming!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes were seldom wrong. The eagles were coming down the wind,\\r\\nline after line, in such a host as must have gathered from all the eyries of the\\r\\nNorth.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Eagles! the Eagles!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bilbo cried, dancing and waving his arms. If the\\r\\nelves could not see him they could hear him. Soon they too took up the cry, and\\r\\nit echoed across the valley. Many wondering eyes looked up, though as yet\\r\\nnothing could be seen except from the southern shoulders of the Mountain.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Eagles!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling\\r\\nfrom above smote heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETURN JOURNEY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Bilbo came to himself, he was literally by himself. He was lying on the\\r\\nflat stones of Ravenhill, and no one was near. A cloudless day, but cold, was\\r\\nbroad above him. He was shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head burned\\r\\nwith fire.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I wonder what has happened?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt any rate I am\\r\\nnot yet one of the fallen heroes; but I suppose there is still time enough for that!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    He sat up painfully. Looking into the valley he could see no living goblins.\\r\\nAfter a while as his head cleared a little, he thought he could see elves moving in\\r\\nthe rocks below. He rubbed his eyes. Surely there was a camp still in the plain\\r\\nsome distance off; and there was a coming and going about the Gate? Dwarves\\r\\nseemed to be busy removing the wall. But all was deadly still. There was no call\\r\\nand no echo of a song. Sorrow seemed to be in the air.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVictory after all, I suppose!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, feeling his aching head. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, it\\r\\nseems a very gloomy business.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Suddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo there!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called with a shaky voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo there! What news?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat voice is it that speaks among the stones?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the man halting and\\r\\npeering about him not far from where Bilbo sat.\\r\\n    Then Bilbo remembered his ring! \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m blessed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis\\r\\ninvisibility has its drawbacks after all. Otherwise I suppose I might have spent a\\r\\nwarm and comfortable night in bed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s me, Bilbo Baggins, companion of Thorin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, hurriedly taking off\\r\\nthe ring.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is well that I have found you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the man striding forward. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are\\r\\nneeded and we have looked for you long. You would have been numbered\\r\\n\\x0camong the dead, who are many, if Gandalf the wizard had not said that your\\r\\nvoice was last heard in this place. I have been sent to look here for the last time.\\r\\nAre you much hurt?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA nasty knock on the head, I think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut I have a helm and a\\r\\nhard skull. All the same I feel sick and my legs are like straws.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will carry you down to the camp in the valley,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the man, and picked\\r\\nhim lightly up.\\r\\n    The man was swift and sure-footed. It was not long before Bilbo was set\\r\\ndown before a tent in Dale; and there stood Gandalf, with his arm in a sling.\\r\\nEven the wizard had not escaped without a wound; and there were few\\r\\nunharmed in all the host.\\r\\n    When Gandalf saw Bilbo, he was delighted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBaggins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he exclaimed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell\\r\\nI never! Alive after all\\xe2\\x80\\x94I am glad! I began to wonder if even your luck would\\r\\nsee you through! A terrible business, and it nearly was disastrous. But other\\r\\nnews can wait. Come!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said more gravely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are called for;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and leading\\r\\nthe hobbit he took him within the tent.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHail! Thorin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said as he entered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have brought him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    There indeed lay Thorin Oakenshield, wounded with many wounds, and his\\r\\nrent armour and notched axe were cast upon the floor. He looked up as Bilbo\\r\\ncame beside him.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarewell, good thief,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI go now to the halls of waiting to sit beside\\r\\nmy fathers, until the world is renewed. Since I leave now all gold and silver, and\\r\\ngo where it is of little worth, I wish to part in friendship from you, and I would\\r\\ntake back my words and deeds at the Gate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Bilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarewell, King under the\\r\\nMountain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is a bitter adventure, if it must end so; and not a\\r\\nmountain of gold can amend it. Yet I am glad that I have shared in your perils\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nthat has been more than any Baggins deserves.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Thorin. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is more in you of good than you know, child of the\\r\\nkindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us\\r\\nvalued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier\\r\\nworld. But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then Bilbo turned away, and he went by himself, and sat alone wrapped in a\\r\\nblanket, and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and\\r\\nhis voice was hoarse. He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long before he\\r\\nhad the heart to make a joke again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA mercy it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last to himself,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat I woke up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, but I am glad that we\\r\\n\\x0cparted in kindness. You are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a great mess of\\r\\nthat business with the stone; and there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to\\r\\nbuy peace and quiet, but I suppose you can hardly be blamed for that.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that had happened after he was stunned, Bilbo learned later; but it gave him\\r\\nmore sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching in\\r\\nhis bones for the homeward journey. That, however, was a little delayed, so in\\r\\nthe meantime I will tell something of events. The Eagles had long had suspicion\\r\\nof the goblins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mustering; from their watchfulness the movements in the\\r\\nmountains could not be altogether hid. So they too had gathered in great\\r\\nnumbers, under the great Eagle of the Misty Mountains; and at length smelling\\r\\nbattle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of time. They\\r\\nit was who dislodged the goblins from the mountain-slopes, casting them over\\r\\nprecipices, or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It\\r\\nwas not long before they had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on\\r\\neither side of the valley could come at last to the help of the battle below.\\r\\n    But even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered. In that last hour Beorn\\r\\nhimself had appeared\\xe2\\x80\\x94no one knew how or from where. He came alone, and in\\r\\nbear\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shape; and he seemed to have grown almost to giant-size in his wrath.\\r\\n    The roar of his voice was like drums and guns; and he tossed wolves and\\r\\ngoblins from his path like straws and feathers. He fell upon their rear, and broke\\r\\nlike a clap of thunder through the ring. The dwarves were making a stand still\\r\\nabout their lords upon a low rounded hill. Then Beorn stooped and lifted Thorin,\\r\\nwho had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of the fray.\\r\\n    Swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could\\r\\nwithstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He scattered the\\r\\nbodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and crushed him. Then dismay fell on\\r\\nthe Goblins and they fled in all directions. But weariness left their enemies with\\r\\nthe coming of new hope, and they pursued them closely, and prevented most of\\r\\nthem from escaping where they could. They drove many of them into the\\r\\nRunning River, and such as fled south or west they hunted into the marshes\\r\\nabout the Forest River; and there the greater part of the last fugitives perished,\\r\\nwhile those that came hardly to the Wood-elves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 realm were there slain, or drawn\\r\\nin to die deep in the trackless dark of Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts\\r\\nof the goblin warriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had\\r\\npeace for many a year.\\r\\n\\x0c    Victory had been assured before the fall of night; but the pursuit was still on\\r\\nfoot, when Bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were in the valley save the\\r\\nmore grievously wounded.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere are the Eagles?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked Gandalf that evening, as he lay wrapped in\\r\\nmany warm blankets.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome are in the hunt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut most have gone back to their\\r\\neyries. They would not stay here, and departed with the first light of morning.\\r\\nDain has crowned their chief with gold, and sworn friendship with them\\r\\nforever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am sorry. I mean, I should have liked to see them again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo\\r\\nsleepily; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps I shall see them on the way home. I suppose I shall be going\\r\\nhome soon?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs soon as you like,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard.\\r\\n    Actually it was some days before Bilbo really set out. They buried Thorin\\r\\ndeep beneath the Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone upon his breast.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere let it lie till the Mountain falls!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay it bring good fortune\\r\\nto all his folk that dwell here after!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist, the elvish sword that had been\\r\\ntaken from Thorin in captivity. It is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark\\r\\nif foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves could not be taken by\\r\\nsurprise. There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode, and he became King\\r\\nunder the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in\\r\\nthe ancient halls. Of the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili and\\r\\nKili had fallen defending him with shield and body, for he was their mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nelder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his treasure well.\\r\\n    There was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such\\r\\nshares as had been planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and\\r\\nOin and Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur\\xe2\\x80\\x94or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth\\r\\nshare of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was given up to Bard;\\r\\nfor Dain said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the\\r\\nArkenstone in his keeping.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of\\r\\nmany mortal kings. From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of\\r\\nLake-town; and he rewarded his followers and friends freely. To the Elvenking\\r\\nhe gave the emeralds of Girion, such jewels as he most loved, which Dain had\\r\\nrestored to him.\\r\\n    To Bilbo he said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis treasure is as much yours as it is mine; though old\\r\\n\\x0cagreements cannot stand, since so many have a claim in its winning and defence.\\r\\nYet even though you were willing to lay aside all your claim, I should wish that\\r\\nthe words of Thorin, of which he repented, should not prove true: that we should\\r\\ngive you little. I would reward you most richly of all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery kind of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut really it is a relief to me. How on earth\\r\\nshould I have got all that treasure home without war and murder all along the\\r\\nway, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what I should have done with it when I got\\r\\nhome. I am sure it is better in your hands.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    In the end he would only take two small chests, one filled with silver, and the\\r\\nother with gold, such as one strong pony could carry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat will be quite as\\r\\nmuch as I can manage,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he.\\r\\n    At last the time came for him to say good-bye to his friends. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarewell,\\r\\nBalin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand farewell, Dwalin; and farewell Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin,\\r\\nBifur, Bofur, and Bombur! May your beards never grow thin!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And turning\\r\\ntowards the Mountain he added: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarewell Thorin Oakenshield! And Fili and\\r\\nKili! May your memory never fade!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then the dwarves bowed low before their Gate, but words stuck in their\\r\\nthroats. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-bye and good luck, wherever you fare!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin at last. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf\\r\\never you visit us again, when our halls are made fair once more, then the feast\\r\\nshall indeed be splendid!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf ever you are passing my way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait to knock! Tea is at\\r\\nfour; but any of you are welcome at any time!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then he turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe elf-host was on the march; and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were glad,\\r\\nfor now the northern world would be merrier for many a long day. The dragon\\r\\nwas dead, and the goblins overthrown, and their hearts looked forward after\\r\\nwinter to a spring of joy.\\r\\n    Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the Elvenking, and beside them strode Beorn,\\r\\nonce again in man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shape, and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon the\\r\\nroad. So they went on until they drew near to the borders of Mirkwood, to the\\r\\nnorth of the place where the Forest River ran out. Then they halted, for the\\r\\nwizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the king bade them\\r\\nstay a while in his halls. They intended to go along the edge of the forest, and\\r\\nround its northern end in the waste that lay between it and the beginning of the\\r\\nGrey Mountains. It was a long and cheerless road, but now that the goblins were\\r\\n\\x0ccrushed, it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathways under the trees.\\r\\nMoreover Beorn was going that way too.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarewell! O Elvenking!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMerry be the greenwood, while the\\r\\nworld is yet young! And merry be all your folk!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFarewell! O Gandalf!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the king. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay you ever appear where you are\\r\\nmost needed and least expected! The oftener you appear in my halls the better\\r\\nshall I be pleased!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI beg of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto accept\\r\\nthis gift!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he brought out a necklace of silver and pearls that Dain had given\\r\\nhim at their parting.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn what way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the king.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, er, I thought, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo rather confused, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat, er,\\r\\nsome little return should be made for your, er, hospitality. I mean even a burglar\\r\\nhas his feelings. I have drunk much of your wine and eaten much of your bread.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will take your gift, O Bilbo the Magnificent!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the king gravely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I\\r\\nname you elf-friend and blessed. May your shadow never grow less (or stealing\\r\\nwould be too easy)! Farewell!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    Then the elves turned towards the Forest, and Bilbo started on his long road\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still\\r\\nthe Wild, and there were many other things in it in those days beside goblins; but\\r\\nhe was well guided and well guarded\\xe2\\x80\\x94the wizard was with him, and Beorn for\\r\\nmuch of the way\\xe2\\x80\\x94and he was never in great danger again. Anyway by\\r\\nmidwinter Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back, along both edges of the\\r\\nForest, to the doors of Beorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house; and there for a while they both stayed.\\r\\nYule-tide was warm and merry there; and men came from far and wide to feast at\\r\\nBeorn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bidding. The goblins of the Misty Mountains were now few and\\r\\nterrified, and hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the Wargs had\\r\\nvanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear. Beorn indeed\\r\\nbecame a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between\\r\\nthe mountains and the wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of\\r\\nhis line had the power of taking bear\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shape, and some were grim men and bad,\\r\\nbut most were in heart like Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day the last\\r\\ngoblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the\\r\\nedge of the Wild.\\r\\n\\x0c   It was spring, and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun, before\\r\\nBilbo and Gandalf took their leave at last of Beorn, and though he longed for\\r\\nhome, Bilbo left with regret, for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were in\\r\\nspringtime no less marvellous than in high summer.\\r\\n   At last they came up the long road, and reached the very pass where the\\r\\ngoblins had captured them before. But they came to that high point at morning,\\r\\nand looking backward they saw a white sun shining over the outstretched lands.\\r\\nThere behind lay Mirkwood, blue in the distance, and darkly green at the nearer\\r\\nedge even in the spring. There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of\\r\\neyesight. On its highest peak snow yet unmelted was gleaming pale.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo,\\r\\nand he turned his back on his adventure. The Tookish part was getting very tired,\\r\\nand the Baggins was daily getting stronger. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish now only to be in my own\\r\\narmchair!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n\\x0cChapter XIX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LAST STAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley\\r\\nof Rivendell, where stood the Last (or the First) Homely House. Again it was\\r\\nevening, their ponies were tired, especially the one that carried the baggage; and\\r\\nthey all felt in need of rest. As they rode down the steep path, Bilbo heard the\\r\\nelves still singing in the trees, as if they had not stopped since he left; and as\\r\\nsoon as the riders came down into the lower glades of the wood they burst into a\\r\\nsong of much the same kind as before. This is something like it:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The dragon is withered,\\r\\n       His bones are now crumbled;\\r\\n       His armour is shivered,\\r\\n       His splendour is humbled!\\r\\n       Though sword shall be rusted,\\r\\n       And throne and crown perish\\r\\n       With strength that men trusted\\r\\n       And wealth that they cherish,\\r\\n       Here grass is still growing,\\r\\n       And leaves are yet swinging,\\r\\n       The white water flowing,\\r\\n       And elves are yet singing\\r\\n         Come! Tra-la-la-lally!\\r\\n         Come back to the valley!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       The stars are far brighter\\r\\n\\x0c       Than gems without measure,\\r\\n       The moon is far whiter\\r\\n       Than silver in treasure;\\r\\n       The fire is more shining\\r\\n       On hearth in the gloaming\\r\\n       Than gold won by mining,\\r\\n       So why go a-roaming?\\r\\n         O! Tra-la-la-lally\\r\\n         Come back to the Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       O! Where are you going,\\r\\n       So late in returning?\\r\\n       The river is flowing,\\r\\n       The stars are all burning!\\r\\n       O! Whither so laden,\\r\\n       So sad and so dreary?\\r\\n       Here elf and elf-maiden\\r\\n       Now welcome the weary\\r\\n         With Tra-la-la-lally\\r\\n         Come back to the Valley,\\r\\n             Tra-la-la-lally\\r\\n             Fa-la-la-lally\\r\\n                Fa-la!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    Then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across\\r\\nthe water to the house of Elrond. There a warm welcome was made them, and\\r\\nthere were many eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their adventures.\\r\\nGandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the\\r\\ntale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the wizard\\r\\non their homeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again he\\r\\nwould open one eye, and listen, when a part of the story which he did not yet\\r\\nknow came in.\\r\\n    It was in this way that he learned where Gandalf had been to; for he\\r\\noverheard the words of the wizard to Elrond. It appeared that Gandalf had been\\r\\nto a great council of the white wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and that\\r\\nthey had at last driven the Necromancer from his dark hold in the south of\\r\\n\\x0cMirkwood.\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEre long now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gandalf was saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Forest will grow somewhat more\\r\\nwholesome. The North will be freed from that horror for many long years, I\\r\\nhope. Yet I wish he were banished from the world!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be well indeed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Elrond; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I fear that will not come about in\\r\\nthis age of the world, or for many after.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n     When the tale of their journeyings was told, there were other tales, and yet\\r\\nmore tales, tales of long ago, and tales of new things, and tales of no time at all,\\r\\ntill Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head fell forward on his chest, and he snored comfortably in a corner.\\r\\n     He woke to find himself in a white bed, and the moon shining through an\\r\\nopen window. Below it many elves were singing loud and clear on the banks of\\r\\nthe stream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Sing all ye joyful, now sing all together!\\r\\n       The wind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the tree-top, the wind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the heather;\\r\\n       The stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower,\\r\\n       And bright are the windows of Night in her tower.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Dance all ye joyful, now dance all together!\\r\\n       Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather!\\r\\n       The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting;\\r\\n       Merry is May-time, and merry our meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Sing we now softly, and dreams let us weave him!\\r\\n       Wind him in slumber and there let us leave him!\\r\\n       The wanderer sleepeth. Now soft be his pillow!\\r\\n       Lullaby! Lullaby! Alder and Willow!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Sigh no more Pine, till the wind of the morn!\\r\\n         Fall Moon! Dark be the land!\\r\\n         Hush! Hush! Oak, Ash, and Thorn!\\r\\n       Hushed be all water, till dawn is at hand!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, Merry People!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo looking out. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat time by the moon is\\r\\n\\x0cthis? Your lullaby would waken a drunken goblin! Yet I thank you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd your snores would waken a stone dragon\\xe2\\x80\\x94yet we thank you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they\\r\\nanswered with laughter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is drawing towards dawn, and you have slept now\\r\\nsince the night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beginning. Tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of weariness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA little sleep does a great cure in the house of Elrond,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I will\\r\\ntake all the cure I can get. A second good night, fair friends!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And with that he\\r\\nwent back to bed and slept till late morning.\\r\\n    Weariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and\\r\\ndance, early and late, with the elves of the valley. Yet even that place could not\\r\\nlong delay him now, and he thought always of his own home. After a week,\\r\\ntherefore, he said farewell to Elrond, and giving him such small gifts as he\\r\\nwould accept, he rode away with Gandalf.\\r\\n    Even as they left the valley the sky darkened in the West before them, and\\r\\nwind and rain came up to meet them.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMerry is May-time!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, as the rain beat into his face. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut our back\\r\\nis to legends and we are coming home. I suppose this is the first taste of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a long road yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it is the last road,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo.\\r\\n    They came to the river that marked the very edge of the borderland of the\\r\\nWild, and to the ford beneath the steep bank, which you may remember. The\\r\\nwater was swollen both with the melting of the snows at the approach of\\r\\nsummer, and with the daylong rain; but they crossed with some difficulty, and\\r\\npressed forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of their journey.\\r\\n    This was much as it had been before, except that the company was smaller,\\r\\nand more silent; also this time there were no trolls. At each point on the road\\r\\nBilbo recalled the happenings and the words of a year ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94it seemed to him\\r\\nmore like ten\\xe2\\x80\\x94so that, of course, he quickly noted the place where the pony had\\r\\nfallen in the river, and they had turned aside for their nasty adventure with Tom\\r\\nand Bert and Bill.\\r\\n    Not far from the road they found the gold of the trolls, which they had buried,\\r\\nstill hidden and untouched. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have enough to last me my time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo,\\r\\nwhen they had dug it up. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou had better take this, Gandalf. I daresay you can\\r\\nfind a use for it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndeed I can!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the wizard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut share and share alike! You may find\\r\\nyou have more needs than you expect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    So they put the gold in bags and slung them on the ponies, who were not at\\r\\nall pleased about it. After that their going was slower, for most of the time they\\r\\n\\x0cwalked. But the land was green and there was much grass through which the\\r\\nhobbit strolled along contentedly. He mopped his face with a red silk\\r\\nhandkerchief\\xe2\\x80\\x94no! not a single one of his own had survived, he had borrowed\\r\\nthis one from Elrond\\xe2\\x80\\x94for now June had brought summer, and the weather was\\r\\nbright and hot again.\\r\\n    As all things come to an end, even this story, a day came at last when they\\r\\nwere in sight of the country where Bilbo had been born and bred, where the\\r\\nshapes of the land and of the trees were as well known to him as his hands and\\r\\ntoes. Coming to a rise he could see his own Hill in the distance, and he stopped\\r\\nsuddenly and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Roads go ever ever on,\\r\\n          Over rock and under tree,\\r\\n       By caves where never sun has shone,\\r\\n          By streams that never find the sea;\\r\\n       Over snow by winter sown,\\r\\n          And through the merry flowers of June,\\r\\n       Over grass and over stone,\\r\\n          And under mountains in the moon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       Roads go ever ever on\\r\\n           Under cloud and under star,\\r\\n       Yet feet that wandering have gone\\r\\n           Turn at last to home afar.\\r\\n       Eyes that fire and sword have seen\\r\\n           And horror in the halls of stone\\r\\n       Look at last on meadows green\\r\\n           And trees and hills they long have known.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n   Gandalf looked at him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy dear Bilbo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething is the matter\\r\\nwith you! You are not the hobbit that you were.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n   And so they crossed the bridge and passed the mill by the river and came\\r\\nright back to Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own door.\\r\\n   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBless me! What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. There was a great commotion, and\\r\\npeople of all sorts, respectable and unrespectable, were thick round the door, and\\r\\n\\x0cmany were going in and out\\xe2\\x80\\x94not even wiping their feet on the mat, as Bilbo\\r\\nnoticed with annoyance.\\r\\n     If he was surprised, they were more surprised still. He had arrived back in the\\r\\nmiddle of an auction! There was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate,\\r\\nstating that on June the Twenty-second Messrs Grubb, Grubb, and Burrowes\\r\\nwould sell by auction the effects of the late Bilbo Baggins Esquire, of Bag-End,\\r\\nUnderhill, Hobbiton. Sale to commence at ten o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock sharp. It was now nearly\\r\\nlunchtime, and most of the things had already been sold, for various prices from\\r\\nnext to nothing to old songs (as is not unusual at auctions). Bilbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cousins the\\r\\nSackville-Bagginses were, in fact, busy measuring his rooms to see if their own\\r\\nfurniture would fit. In short Bilbo was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPresumed Dead\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and not everybody that\\r\\nsaid so was sorry to find the presumption wrong.\\r\\n     The return of Mr. Bilbo Baggins created quite a disturbance, both under the\\r\\nHill and over the Hill, and across the Water; it was a great deal more than a nine\\r\\ndays\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wonder. The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a long time\\r\\nbefore Mr. Baggins was in fact admitted to be alive again. The people who had\\r\\ngot specially good bargains at the Sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end\\r\\nto save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture. Many of his\\r\\nsilver spoons mysteriously disappeared and were never accounted for. Personally\\r\\nhe suspected the Sackville-Bagginses. On their side they never admitted that the\\r\\nreturned Baggins was genuine, and they were not on friendly terms with Bilbo\\r\\never after. They really had wanted to live in his nice hobbit-hole so very much.\\r\\n     Indeed Bilbo found he had lost more than spoons\\xe2\\x80\\x94he had lost his reputation.\\r\\nIt is true that for ever after he remained an elf-friend, and had the honour of\\r\\ndwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever passed that way; but he was no\\r\\nlonger quite respectable. He was in fact held by all the hobbits of the\\r\\nneighbourhood to be \\xe2\\x80\\x98queer\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94except by his nephews and nieces on the Took\\r\\nside, but even they were not encouraged in their friendship by their elders.\\r\\n     I am sorry to say he did not mind. He was quite content; and the sound of the\\r\\nkettle on his hearth was ever after more musical than it had been even in the\\r\\nquiet days before the Unexpected Party. His sword he hung over the\\r\\nmantelpiece. His coat of mail was arranged on a stand in the hall (until he lent it\\r\\nto a Museum). His gold and silver was largely spent in presents, both useful and\\r\\nextravagant\\xe2\\x80\\x94which to a certain extent accounts for the affection of his nephews\\r\\nand his nieces. His magic ring he kept a great secret, for he chiefly used it when\\r\\nunpleasant callers came.\\r\\n     He took to writing poetry and visiting the elves; and though many shook their\\r\\n\\x0cheads and touched their foreheads and said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor old Baggins!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and though few\\r\\nbelieved any of his tales, he remained very happy to the end of his days, and\\r\\nthose were extraordinarily long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne autumn evening some years afterwards Bilbo was sitting in his study\\r\\nwriting his memoirs\\xe2\\x80\\x94he thought of calling them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere and Back Again, a\\r\\nHobbit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Holiday\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94when there was a ring at the door. It was Gandalf and a\\r\\ndwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome in! Come in!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo, and soon they were settled in chairs by the\\r\\nfire. If Balin noticed that Mr. Baggins\\xe2\\x80\\x99 waistcoat was more extensive (and had\\r\\nreal gold buttons), Bilbo also noticed that Balin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beard was several inches\\r\\nlonger, and his jewelled belt was of great magnificence.\\r\\n    They fell to talking of their times together, of course, and Bilbo asked how\\r\\nthings were going in the lands of the Mountain. It seemed they were going very\\r\\nwell. Bard had rebuilt the town in Dale and men had gathered to him from the\\r\\nLake and from South and West, and all the valley had become tilled again and\\r\\nrich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and blossoms in spring and\\r\\nfruit and feasting in autumn. And Lake-town was refounded and was more\\r\\nprosperous than ever, and much wealth went up and down the Running River;\\r\\nand there was friendship in those parts between elves and dwarves and men.\\r\\n\\x0cThe Hall at Bag-End Residence of B. Baggins Esquire\\r\\n\\x0c    The old Master had come to a bad end. Bard had given him much gold for the\\r\\nhelp of the Lake-people, but being of the kind that easily catches such disease he\\r\\nfell under the dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and fled with it, and\\r\\ndied of starvation in the Waste, deserted by his companions.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe new Master is of wiser kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Balin, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand very popular, for, of\\r\\ncourse, he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity. They are making\\r\\nsongs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a\\r\\nfashion!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo.\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Gandalf. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd why should not they prove true? Surely you\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about\\r\\nyourself? You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes\\r\\nwere managed by mere luck, just for your sole benefit? You are a very fine\\r\\nperson, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little\\r\\nfellow in a wide world after all!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank goodness!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.\\r\\n\\x0c\\x0c               WORKS BY J.R.R.
